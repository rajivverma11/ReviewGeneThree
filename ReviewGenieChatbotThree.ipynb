With some careful planning and preparation, you can create a stylish backsplash that is long-lasting and easy to maintain. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to properly install wallpaper as a backsplash in your home.\\nChoose the Right Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nWhen selecting a wallpaper for a backsplash application, you’ll want to consider:\\n\\nMoisture resistance – Since the backsplash will be installed behind a sink or stove where it will be exposed to moisture, choose a vinyl or paper wallpaper specifically designed for high-humidity areas. Avoid regular paper wallpapers.\\nWashability – Pick a scrubbable and stain-resistant wallpaper, so it will be easy to keep clean.\\nSize of pattern – Smaller scale patterns will be easiest to work with. Large patterns can be tricky to line up.\\nSheen – Consider how the sheen (matte, satin, semi-gloss, etc.) will interact with your lighting. Glossier papers will be easier to wipe clean.\\nAdhesive – For backsplashes, always use a permanent, heavy-duty adhesive to prevent peeling or bubbling.\\nQuantity – Measure to determine how much wallpaper you will need to cover your backsplash area. Don’t forget to account for pattern matching and cutting allowance.\\n\\nPrepare the Surface\\nProper surface prep is crucial for successful wallpaper installation.\\n\\nMake sure the surface is clean, dry, smooth, and free of grease. Fill any cracks or holes with spackle.\\nSand glossy surfaces lightly to “rough up” and improve adhesion.\\nPrime walls before installing the wallpaper, especially if painting previously. Use an interior wallpaper primer or sealer.\\nFor tile backsplashes, scuff the surface with sandpaper so the adhesive adheres well. Clean thoroughly after sanding.\\n\\nPlan the Layout\\n\\nDecide on your starting point based on the pattern size and shape. It often works best to start in a less visible corner.\\nDetermine if you will need to cut any edges to fit your backsplash area cleanly. Plan ahead for straight cuts.\\nMake sure to match patterns from strip to strip. Plan the layout so seams fall between tiles or at grout lines.\\n\\nPrepare the Wallpaper\\n\\nUnroll the wallpaper and allow it to relax according to manufacturer directions, usually 10-20 minutes.\\nUsing a sharp razor blade, straightedge or wallpaper trimmer, neatly trim off the factory edges. Cut wallpaper strips to your desired length.\\nDraw plumb lines on the surface as guides for your first strip. Use a level and pencil.\\n\\nApply Adhesive\\n\\nApply an even coat of heavy-duty wallpaper adhesive directly onto the backsplash surface using a paint roller or wide brush. Don’t get adhesive on the face of the wallpaper.\\nFold book ends of the strips to keep edges clean and prevent sticking during application.\\nAllow adhesive to become tacky according to manufacturer’s directions before applying wallpaper. This is known as “open time”.\\n\\nInstall the Wallpaper\\n\\nHang your first strip, sliding it into position using a wallpaper smoother or plastic scraper. Move from the middle outwards to squeeze out air pockets. Use a level to keep the strip straight.\\nUse a razor blade to trim excess paper at ceilings, countertops or edges. Make straight cuts.\\nApply the next strip directly beside the first, being careful to match the pattern precisely at the seam. Overlap edges slightly.\\nUse a seam roller to set the seam firmly. Roll the entire strip to smooth and adhere, eliminating bubbles or wrinkles.\\nContinue applying additional strips in this same manner until the backsplash is fully covered.\\nAt corners or outlets, carefully cut the wallpaper to fit using an X-acto knife and metal ruler. Take your time here for best results.\\nWhen finished, wipe the entire surface with a clean, damp sponge to remove any adhesive residue.\\n\\nApply Wallpaper Finishing\\n\\nOnce the wallpaper is fully adhered, apply an acrylic wallpaper primer/sealer over the entire backsplash surface. This provides added protection from moisture damage.\\nUse a smoothing brush or mini roller, and apply according to the manufacturer’s directions.\\nFinally, consider applying a clear acrylic wallpaper top-coat to add a washable, water-resistant layer of protection. This is highly recommended for backsplashes.\\n\\nWith careful prep and installation, your new wallpaper backsplash will provide a beautiful focal point in your kitchen or bathroom for years to come! Be sure to properly clean and maintain it by wiping gently with a damp sponge or soft cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scrubbing aggressively. Enjoy your stylish new backsplash!\\nFrequently Asked Questions About Installing a Wallpaper Backsplash\\nWhat type of wall surface works best for a wallpaper backsplash?\\nThe best surfaces for adhering wallpaper are smooth drywall, plaster, concrete, wood paneling, or primed surfaces. Avoid heavily textured or porous surfaces.\\nShould I apply primer before installing wallpaper on a backsplash?\\nPriming provides a uniform, sealed surface that will improve adhesion. Use a high-quality acrylic primer made specifically for wallpaper.\\nWhat’s the best way to measure for the amount of wallpaper I’ll need?\\nCarefully measure the backsplash area’s dimensions. Add at least 6 inches on all sides to allow for trimming. Factor in pattern matching too.\\nHow do I cut wallpaper cleanly on an uneven or textured surface?\\nUse a specialty wallpaper knife with a hooked blade. Keep the knife flat against the surface to cut precisely.\\nShould seams be vertical or horizontal on a backsplash?\\nHorizontal seams are easier to hide by lining them up with tile grout lines. Vertical seams work too. Avoid outside corners.\\nWhat if my backsplash area has an outlet that needs covering?\\nCarefully measure and cut the wallpaper with an X-acto knife around the outlet. Take your time for clean results.\\nHow soon can I use my backsplash after installing wallpaper?\\nAllow all adhesive to dry completely, usually 24-48 hours. Avoid moisture until fully cured. Gently wipe clean with a damp sponge.\\nConclusion\\nInstalling wallpaper can completely transform the look of a backsplash while adding color, texture and interest to your space. With some careful surface preparation and layout planning, the project can easily be DIYed in a weekend.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion.

Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean.

I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. For modern developments in AI, see artificial intelligence.\\nAlan Turing and the beginning of AI\\nTheoretical work\\nThe earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing. In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing machine consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory, symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols. The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s stored-program concept, and implicit in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program. Turing’s conception is now known simply as the universal Turing machine. All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines.\\nDuring World War II Turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the Government Code and Cypher School in Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England. Turing could not turn to the project of building a stored-program electronic computing machine until the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945. Nevertheless, during the war he gave considerable thought to the issue of machine intelligence. One of Turing’s colleagues at Bletchley Park, Donald Michie (who later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh), later recalled that Turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems through the use of guiding principles—a process now known as heuristic problem solving.\\nTuring gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture (London, 1947) to mention computer intelligence, saying, “What we want is a machine that can learn from experience,” and that the “possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this.” In 1948 he introduced many of the central concepts of AI in a report entitled “Intelligent Machinery.” However, Turing did not publish this paper, and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others. For instance, one of Turing’s original ideas was to train a network of artificial neurons to perform specific tasks, an approach described in the section Connectionism.\\nChess\\nAt Bletchley Park Turing illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to chess—a useful source of challenging and clearly defined problems against which proposed methods for problem solving could be tested. In principle, a chess-playing computer could play by searching exhaustively through all the available moves, but in practice this is impossible because it would involve examining an astronomically large number of moves. Heuristics are necessary to guide a narrower, more discriminative search. Although Turing experimented with designing chess programs, he had to content himself with theory in the absence of a computer to run his chess program. The first true AI programs had to await the arrival of stored-program electronic digital computers.\\n\\nGarry Kasparov playing against Deep BlueWorld chess champion Garry Kasparov (left) taking a pawn in the opening minutes of a six-game, six-day chess match against IBM\\'s Deep Blue computer in Philadelphia, February 10, 1996. Feng-hsiung Hsu (right), the principal designer of Deep Blue, keys a move into the computer. The computer, capable of computing 200 million positions per second, was powerful enough to be comparable to Kasparov in its level of play. Kasparov beat Deep Blue 4–2 but lost in a rematch the following year 3 ½–2 ½.(more)\\nIn 1945 Turing predicted that computers would one day play very good chess, and just over 50 years later, in 1997, Deep Blue, a chess computer built by IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), beat the reigning world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. While Turing’s prediction came true, his expectation that chess programming would contribute to the understanding of how human beings think did not. The huge improvement in computer chess since Turing’s day is attributable to advances in computer engineering rather than advances in AI: Deep Blue’s 256 parallel processors enabled it to examine 200 million possible moves per second and to look ahead as many as 14 turns of play. Many agree with Noam Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who opined that a computer beating a grandmaster at chess is about as interesting as a bulldozer winning an Olympic weightlifting competition.\\nThe Turing test\\nIn 1950 Turing sidestepped the traditional debate concerning the definition of intelligence by introducing a practical test for computer intelligence that is now known simply as the Turing test. The Turing test involves three participants: a computer, a human interrogator, and a human foil. The interrogator attempts to determine, by asking questions of the other two participants, which is the computer. All communication is via keyboard and display screen. The interrogator may ask questions as penetrating and wide-ranging as necessary, and the computer is permitted to do everything possible to force a wrong identification. (For instance, the computer might answer “No” in response to “Are you a computer?” and might follow a request to multiply one large number by another with a long pause and an incorrect answer.) The foil must help the interrogator to make a correct identification. A number of different people play the roles of interrogator and foil, and, if a sufficient proportion of the interrogators are unable to distinguish the computer from the human being, then (according to proponents of Turing’s test) the computer is considered an intelligent, thinking entity.\\n\\nAre you a student?\\nGet a special academic rate on Britannica Premium.\\nSubscribe\\nIn 1991 the American philanthropist Hugh Loebner started the annual Loebner Prize competition, promising $100,000 to the first computer to pass the Turing test and awarding $2,000 each year to the best effort. However, no AI program has come close to passing an undiluted Turing test. In late 2022 the advent of the large language model ChatGPT reignited conversation about the likelihood that the components of the Turing test had been met. BuzzFeed data scientist Max Woolf said that ChatGPT had passed the Turing test in December 2022, but some experts claim that ChatGPT did not pass a true Turing test, because, in ordinary usage, ChatGPT often states that it is a language model.\\nEarly milestones in AI\\nThe first AI programs\\nThe earliest successful AI program was written in 1951 by Christopher Strachey, later director of the Programming Research Group at the University of Oxford. Strachey’s checkers (draughts) program ran on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester, England. By the summer of 1952 this program could play a complete game of checkers at a reasonable speed.\\nInformation about the earliest successful demonstration of machine learning was published in 1952. Shopper, written by Anthony Oettinger at the University of Cambridge, ran on the EDSAC computer. Shopper’s simulated world was a mall of eight shops. When instructed to purchase an item, Shopper would search for it, visiting shops at random until the item was found. While searching, Shopper would memorize a few of the items stocked in each shop visited (just as a human shopper might). The next time Shopper was sent out for the same item, or for some other item that it had already located, it would go to the right shop straight away. This simple form of learning is called rote learning.\\nThe first AI program to run in the United States also was a checkers program, written in 1952 by Arthur Samuel for the prototype of the IBM 701. Samuel took over the essentials of Strachey’s checkers program and over a period of years considerably extended it. In 1955 he added features that enabled the program to learn from experience. Samuel included mechanisms for both rote learning and generalization, enhancements that eventually led to his program’s winning one game against a former Connecticut checkers champion in 1962.\\nEvolutionary computing\\nSamuel’s checkers program was also notable for being one of the first efforts at evolutionary computing. (His program “evolved” by pitting a modified copy against the current best version of his program, with the winner becoming the new standard.) Evolutionary computing typically involves the use of some automatic method of generating and evaluating successive “generations” of a program, until a highly proficient solution evolves.\\nA leading proponent of evolutionary computing, John Holland, also wrote test software for the prototype of the IBM 701 computer. In particular, he helped design a neural-network virtual rat that could be trained to navigate through a maze. This work convinced Holland of the efficacy of the bottom-up approach to AI, which involves creating neural networks in imitation of the brain’s structure. While continuing to consult for IBM, Holland moved to the University of Michigan in 1952 to pursue a doctorate in mathematics. He soon switched, however, to a new interdisciplinary program in computers and information processing (later known as communications science) created by Arthur Burks, one of the builders of ENIAC and its successor EDVAC. In his 1959 dissertation, for what was likely the world’s first computer science Ph.D., Holland proposed a new type of computer—a multiprocessor computer—that would assign each artificial neuron in a network to a separate processor. (In 1985 Daniel Hillis solved the engineering difficulties to build the first such computer, the 65,536-processor Thinking Machines Corporation supercomputer.)\\nHolland joined the faculty at Michigan after graduation and over the next four decades directed much of the research into methods of automating evolutionary computing, a process now known by the term genetic algorithms. Systems implemented in Holland’s laboratory included a chess program, models of single-cell biological organisms, and a classifier system for controlling a simulated gas-pipeline network. Genetic algorithms are no longer restricted to academic demonstrations, however; in one important practical application, a genetic algorithm cooperates with a witness to a crime in order to generate a portrait of the perpetrator.\\nLogical reasoning and problem solving\\nThe ability to reason logically is an important aspect of intelligence and has always been a major focus of AI research. An important landmark in this area was a theorem-proving program written in 1955–56 by Allen Newell and J. Clifford Shaw of the RAND Corporation and Herbert Simon of Carnegie Mellon University. The Logic Theorist, as the program became known, was designed to prove theorems from Principia Mathematica (1910–13), a three-volume work by the British philosopher-mathematicians Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. In one instance, a proof devised by the program was more elegant than the proof given in the books.\\nNewell, Simon, and Shaw went on to write a more powerful program, the General Problem Solver, or GPS. The first version of GPS ran in 1957, and work continued on the project for about a decade. GPS could solve an impressive variety of puzzles using a trial and error approach. However, one criticism of GPS, and similar programs that lack any learning capability, is that the program’s intelligence is entirely secondhand, coming from whatever information the programmer explicitly includes.\\nEnglish dialogue\\nTwo of the best-known early AI programs, Eliza and Parry, gave an eerie semblance of intelligent conversation. (Details of both were first published in 1966.) Eliza, written by Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT’s AI Laboratory, simulated a human therapist. Parry, written by Stanford University psychiatrist Kenneth Colby, simulated a human experiencing paranoia. Psychiatrists who were asked to decide whether they were communicating with Parry or a human experiencing paranoia were often unable to tell. Nevertheless, neither Parry nor Eliza could reasonably be described as intelligent. Parry’s contributions to the conversation were canned—constructed in advance by the programmer and stored away in the computer’s memory. Eliza, too, relied on canned sentences and simple programming tricks.\\nAI programming languages\\nIn the course of their work on the Logic Theorist and GPS, Newell, Simon, and Shaw developed their Information Processing Language (IPL), a computer language tailored for AI programming. At the heart of IPL was a highly flexible data structure that they called a list. A list is simply an ordered sequence of items of data. Some or all of the items in a list may themselves be lists. This scheme leads to richly branching structures.\\nIn 1960 John McCarthy combined elements of IPL with the lambda calculus (a formal mathematical-logical system) to produce the programming language LISP (List Processor), which for decades was the principal language for AI work in the United States, before it was supplanted in the 21st century by such languages as Python, Java, and C++. (The lambda calculus itself was invented in 1936 by Princeton logician Alonzo Church while he was investigating the abstract Entscheidungsproblem, or “decision problem,” for predicate logic—the same problem that Turing had been attacking when he invented the universal Turing machine.)\\nThe logic programming language PROLOG (Programmation en Logique) was conceived by Alain Colmerauer at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, where the language was first implemented in 1973. PROLOG was further developed by the logician Robert Kowalski, a member of the AI group at the University of Edinburgh. This language makes use of a powerful theorem-proving technique known as resolution, invented in 1963 at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission’s Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois by the British logician Alan Robinson. PROLOG can determine whether or not a given statement follows logically from other given statements. For example, given the statements “All logicians are rational” and “Robinson is a logician,” a PROLOG program responds in the affirmative to the query “Robinson is rational?” PROLOG was widely used for AI work, especially in Europe and Japan.\\nMicroworld programs\\nTo cope with the bewildering complexity of the real world, scientists often ignore less relevant details; for instance, physicists often ignore friction and elasticity in their models. In 1970 Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that, likewise, AI research should focus on developing programs capable of intelligent behavior in simpler artificial environments known as microworlds. Much research has focused on the so-called blocks world, which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface.\\nAn early success of the microworld approach was SHRDLU, written by Terry Winograd of MIT. (Details of the program were published in 1972.) SHRDLU controlled a robot arm that operated above a flat surface strewn with play blocks. Both the arm and the blocks were virtual. SHRDLU would respond to commands typed in natural English, such as “Will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid.” The program could also answer questions about its own actions. Although SHRDLU was initially hailed as a major breakthrough, Winograd soon announced that the program was, in fact, a dead end. The techniques pioneered in the program proved unsuitable for application in wider, more interesting worlds. Moreover, the appearance that SHRDLU gave of understanding the blocks microworld, and English statements concerning it, was in fact an illusion. SHRDLU had no idea what a green block was.\\n\\nShakeyShakey, a mobile robot, was developed (1968–72) at the Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, California. The robot is equipped with a television camera, a range finder, and collision sensors that enable a minicomputer to control its actions remotely. Shakey can perform a few basic actions, such as go forward, turn, and push, albeit at a very slow pace. Contrasting colors, particularly the dark baseboard on each wall, help the robot to distinguish separate surfaces.(more)\\nAnother product of the microworld approach was Shakey, a mobile robot developed at the Stanford Research Institute by Bertram Raphael, Nils Nilsson, and others during the period 1968–72. The robot occupied a specially built microworld consisting of walls, doorways, and a few simply shaped wooden blocks. Each wall had a carefully painted baseboard to enable the robot to “see” where the wall met the floor (a simplification of reality that is typical of the microworld approach). Shakey had about a dozen basic abilities, such as TURN, PUSH, and CLIMB-RAMP. Critics pointed out the highly simplified nature of Shakey’s environment and emphasized that, despite these simplifications, Shakey operated excruciatingly slowly; a series of actions that a human could plan out and execute in minutes took Shakey days.\\nThe greatest success of the microworld approach is a type of program known as an expert system, described in the next section.\\nExpert systems\\nExpert systems occupy a type of microworld—for example, a model of a ship’s hold and its cargo—that is self-contained and relatively uncomplicated. For such AI systems every effort is made to incorporate all the information about some narrow field that an expert (or group of experts) would know, so that a good expert system can often outperform any single human expert. There are many commercial expert systems, including programs for medical diagnosis, chemical analysis, credit authorization, financial management, corporate planning, financial document routing, oil and mineral prospecting, genetic engineering, automobile design and manufacture, camera lens design, computer installation design, airline scheduling, cargo placement, and automatic help services for home computer owners.\\nKnowledge and inference\\nThe basic components of an expert system are a knowledge base, or KB, and an inference engine. The information to be stored in the KB is obtained by interviewing people who are expert in the area in question. The interviewer, or knowledge engineer, organizes the information elicited from the experts into a collection of rules, typically of an “if-then” structure. Rules of this type are called production rules. The inference engine enables the expert system to draw deductions from the rules in the KB. For example, if the KB contains the production rules “if x, then y” and “if y, then z,” the inference engine is able to deduce “if x, then z.” The expert system might then query its user, “Is x true in the situation that we are considering?” If the answer is affirmative, the system will proceed to infer z.\\nSome expert systems use fuzzy logic. In standard logic there are only two truth values, true and false. This absolute precision makes vague attributes or situations difficult to characterize. (For example, when, precisely, does a thinning head of hair become a bald head?) Often the rules that human experts use contain vague expressions, and so it is useful for an expert system’s inference engine to employ fuzzy logic.\\nDENDRAL\\nIn 1965 the AI researcher Edward Feigenbaum and the geneticist Joshua Lederberg, both of Stanford University, began work on Heuristic DENDRAL (later shortened to DENDRAL), a chemical-analysis expert system. The substance to be analyzed might, for example, be a complicated compound of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Starting from spectrographic data obtained from the substance, DENDRAL would hypothesize the substance’s molecular structure. DENDRAL’s performance rivaled that of chemists expert at this task, and the program was used in industry and in academia.\\nMYCIN\\nWork on MYCIN, an expert system for treating blood infections, began at Stanford University in 1972. MYCIN would attempt to diagnose patients based on reported symptoms and medical test results. The program could request further information concerning the patient, as well as suggest additional laboratory tests, to arrive at a probable diagnosis, after which it would recommend a course of treatment. If requested, MYCIN would explain the reasoning that led to its diagnosis and recommendation. Using about 500 production rules, MYCIN operated at roughly the same level of competence as human specialists in blood infections and rather better than general practitioners.\\nNevertheless, expert systems have no common sense or understanding of the limits of their expertise. For instance, if MYCIN were told that a patient who had received a gunshot wound was bleeding to death, the program would attempt to diagnose a bacterial cause for the patient’s symptoms. Expert systems can also act on absurd clerical errors, such as prescribing an obviously incorrect dosage of a drug for a patient whose weight and age data were accidentally transposed.\\nThe CYC project\\nCYC is a large experiment in symbolic AI. The project began in 1984 under the auspices of the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium of computer, semiconductor, and electronics manufacturers. In 1995 Douglas Lenat, the CYC project director, spun off the project as Cycorp, Inc., based in Austin, Texas. The most ambitious goal of Cycorp was to build a KB containing a significant percentage of the commonsense knowledge of a human being. Millions of commonsense assertions, or rules, were coded into CYC. The expectation was that this “critical mass” would allow the system itself to extract further rules directly from ordinary prose and eventually serve as the foundation for future generations of expert systems.\\nWith only a fraction of its commonsense KB compiled, CYC could draw inferences that would defeat simpler systems. For example, CYC could infer, “Garcia is wet,” from the statement, “Garcia is finishing a marathon run,” by employing its rules that running a marathon entails high exertion, that people sweat at high levels of exertion, and that when something sweats, it is wet. Among the outstanding remaining problems are issues in searching and problem solving—for example, how to search the KB automatically for information that is relevant to a given problem. AI researchers call the problem of updating, searching, and otherwise manipulating a large structure of symbols in realistic amounts of time the frame problem. Some critics of symbolic AI believe that the frame problem is largely unsolvable and so maintain that the symbolic approach will never yield genuinely intelligent systems. It is possible that CYC, for example, will succumb to the frame problem long before the system achieves human levels of knowledge.'}, {'title': 'AI Timeline: Key Events in Artificial Intelligence from 1950-2025', 'url': 'https://www.theainavigator.com/ai-timeline', 'content': \"Welcome to our AI Timeline, a comprehensive journey through the history of artificial intelligence from 1950 to today.

The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956.[1] Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The U.S. government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true.[2]\\nEventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat.[3] In 1974, criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U.S. Congress led the U.S. and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise. However, investors\\' enthusiasm waned in the 1990s, and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry (a period known as an \"AI winter\"). Nevertheless, research and funding continued to grow under other names.\\nIn the early 2000s, machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets, and the application of solid mathematical methods. Soon after, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The transformer architecture debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications, amongst other use cases.\\nInvestment in AI boomed in the 2020s. The recent AI boom, initiated by the development of transformer architecture, led to the rapid scaling and public releases of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models exhibit human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity, and have been integrated into various sectors, fueling exponential investment in AI. However, concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of advanced AI have also emerged, prompting debate about the future of AI and its impact on society.\\nPrecursors[edit]\\nMythical, fictional, and speculative precursors[edit]\\nMyth and legend[edit]\\nIn Greek mythology, Talos was a giant made of bronze who acted as guardian for the island of Crete. He would throw boulders at the ships of invaders and would complete 3 circuits around the island\\'s perimeter daily.[4] According to pseudo-Apollodorus\\' Bibliotheke, Hephaestus forged Talos with the aid of a cyclops and presented the automaton as a gift to Minos.[5] In the Argonautica, Jason and the Argonauts defeated Talos by removing a plug near his foot, causing the vital ichor to flow out from his body and rendering him lifeless.[6]\\nPygmalion was a legendary king and sculptor of Greek mythology, famously represented in Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses. In the 10th book of Ovid\\'s narrative poem, Pygmalion becomes disgusted with women when he witnesses the way in which the Propoetides prostitute themselves. Despite this, he makes offerings at the temple of Venus asking the goddess to bring to him a woman just like a statue he carved.[7]\\nMedieval legends of artificial beings[edit]\\nDepiction of a homunculus from Goethe\\'s Faust\\nIn Of the Nature of Things, the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus describes a procedure that he claims can fabricate an \"artificial man\". By placing the \"sperm of a man\" in horse dung, and feeding it the \"Arcanum of Mans blood\" after 40 days, the concoction will become a living infant.[8]\\nThe earliest written account regarding golem-making is found in the writings of Eleazar ben Judah of Worms in the early 13th century.[9] During the Middle Ages, it was believed that the animation of a Golem could be achieved by insertion of a piece of paper with any of God\\'s names on it, into the mouth of the clay figure.[10] Unlike legendary automata like Brazen Heads,[11] a Golem was unable to speak.[12]\\nTakwin, the artificial creation of life, was a frequent topic of Ismaili alchemical manuscripts, especially those attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan. Islamic alchemists attempted to create a broad range of life through their work, ranging from plants to animals.[13]\\nIn Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, an alchemically fabricated homunculus, destined to live forever in the flask in which he was made, endeavors to be born into a full human body. Upon the initiation of this transformation, however, the flask shatters and the homunculus dies.[14]\\nModern fiction[edit]\\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction\\nBy the 19th century, ideas about artificial men and thinking machines became a popular theme in fiction. Notable works like Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein and Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R. (Rossum\\'s Universal Robots)[15] explored the concept of artificial life. Speculative essays, such as Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\",[16] and Edgar Allan Poe\\'s \"Maelzel\\'s Chess Player\"[17] reflected society\\'s growing interest in machines with artificial intelligence. AI remains a common topic in science fiction today.[18]\\nAutomata[edit]\\nMain article: Automaton\\nAl-Jazari\\'s programmable automata (1206 CE)\\nRealistic humanoid automata were built by craftsman from many civilizations, including Yan Shi,[19] Hero of Alexandria,[20] Al-Jazari,[21] Haroun al-Rashid,[22] Jacques de Vaucanson,[23][24] Leonardo Torres y Quevedo,[25] Pierre Jaquet-Droz and Wolfgang von Kempelen.[26][27]\\nThe oldest known automata were the sacred statues of ancient Egypt and Greece.[28][29] The faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds, capable of wisdom and emotion—Hermes Trismegistus wrote that \"by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it\".[30] English scholar Alexander Neckham asserted that the Ancient Roman poet Virgil had built a palace with automaton statues.[31]\\nDuring the early modern period, these legendary automata were said to possess the magical ability to answer questions put to them. The late medieval alchemist and proto-Protestant Roger Bacon was purported to have fabricated a brazen head, having developed a legend of having been a wizard.[32][33] These legends were similar to the Norse myth of the Head of Mímir. According to legend, Mímir was known for his intellect and wisdom, and was beheaded in the Æsir-Vanir War. Odin is said to have \"embalmed\" the head with herbs and spoke incantations over it such that Mímir\\'s head remained able to speak wisdom to Odin. Odin then kept the head near him for counsel.[34]\\nFormal reasoning[edit]\\nArtificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. The study of mechanical—or \"formal\"—reasoning has a long history. Chinese, Indian and Greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction by the first millennium BCE. Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as Aristotle (who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism),[35] Euclid (whose Elements was a model of formal reasoning), al-Khwārizmī (who developed algebra and gave his name to the word algorithm) and European scholastic philosophers such as William of Ockham and Duns Scotus.[36]\\nSpanish philosopher Ramon Llull (1232–1315) developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means;[37][38] Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations, produced by the machine by mechanical meanings, in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge.[39] Llull\\'s work had a great influence on Gottfried Leibniz, who redeveloped his ideas.[40]\\nGottfried Leibniz, who speculated that human reason could be reduced to mechanical calculation\\nIn the 17th century, Leibniz, Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry.[41] Hobbes famously wrote in Leviathan: \"For reason ... is nothing but reckoning, that is adding and subtracting\".[42] Leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning, the characteristica universalis, which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that \"there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand, down to their slates, and to say each other (with a friend as witness, if they liked): Let us calculate.\"[43] These philosophers had begun to articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would become the guiding faith of AI research.\\nThe study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible. The foundations had been set by such works as Boole\\'s The Laws of Thought and Frege\\'s Begriffsschrift.[44] Building on Frege\\'s system, Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece, the Principia Mathematica in 1913. Inspired by Russell\\'s success, David Hilbert challenged mathematicians of the 1920s and 30s to answer this fundamental question: \"can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized?\"[36] His question was answered by Gödel\\'s incompleteness proof,[45] Turing\\'s machine[45] and Church\\'s Lambda calculus.[a]\\nUS Army photo of the ENIAC at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering[47]\\nTheir answer was surprising in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction.[45] The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation.[48] This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.\\nComputer science[edit]\\nMain articles: History of computer hardware and History of computer science\\nCalculating machines were designed or built in antiquity and throughout history by many people, including Gottfried Leibniz,[38][49] Joseph Marie Jacquard,[50] Charles Babbage,[50][51] Percy Ludgate,[52] Leonardo Torres Quevedo,[53] Vannevar Bush,[54] and others. Ada Lovelace speculated that Babbage\\'s machine was \"a thinking or ... reasoning machine\", but warned \"It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that arise as to the powers\" of the machine.[55][56]\\nThe first modern computers were the massive machines of the Second World War (such as Konrad Zuse\\'s Z3, Alan Turing\\'s Heath Robinson and Colossus, Atanasoff and Berry\\'s ABC and ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania).[57] ENIAC was based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann,[58] and proved to be the most influential.[57]\\nBirth of artificial intelligence (1941-56)[edit]\\nThe IBM 702: a computer used by the first generation of AI researchers.\\nThe earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener\\'s cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon\\'s information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an \"electronic brain\".\\nIn the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) explored several research directions that would be vital to later AI research.[59] Alan Turing was among the first people to seriously investigate the theoretical possibility of \"machine intelligence\".[60] The field of \"artificial intelligence research\" was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[61]\\nTuring test[62]\\nTuring Test[edit]\\nMain article: Turing test\\nIn 1950 Turing published a landmark paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think.[63][b] In the paper, he noted that \"thinking\" is difficult to define and devised his famous Turing Test: If a machine could carry on a conversation (over a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was \"thinking\".[64] This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a \"thinking machine\" was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition.[65] The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.\\nArtificial neural networks[edit]\\nWalter Pitts and Warren McCulloch analyzed networks of idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical functions in 1943. They were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network.[66] The paper was influenced by Turing\\'s paper \\'On Computable Numbers\\' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean \\'neurons\\', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.[60] One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was Marvin Minsky who was a 24-year-old graduate student at the time. In 1951 Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.[67] Minsky would later become one of the most important leaders and innovators in AI.\\nCybernetic robots[edit]\\nExperimental robots such as W. Grey Walter\\'s turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast, were built in the 1950s. These machines did not use computers, digital electronics or symbolic reasoning; they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry.[68]\\nGame AI[edit]\\nIn 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program[69] and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess.[70] Arthur Samuel\\'s checkers program, the subject of his 1959 paper \"Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers\", eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur.[71] Samuel\\'s program was among the first uses of what would later be called machine learning.[72] Game AI would continue to be used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history.\\nSymbolic reasoning and the Logic Theorist[edit]\\nHerbert Simon (left) in a chess match against Allen Newell c.\\u20091958\\nMain article: Logic theorist\\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought. This was a new approach to creating thinking machines.[73][74]\\nIn 1955, Allen Newell and future Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon created the \"Logic Theorist\", with help from J. C. Shaw. The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead\\'s Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.[75] Simon said that they had \"solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.\"[76][c] The symbolic reasoning paradigm they introduced would dominate AI research and funding until the middle 90s, as well as inspire the cognitive revolution.\\nDartmouth Workshop[edit]\\nMain article: Dartmouth workshop\\nThe Dartmouth workshop of 1956 was a pivotal event that marked the formal inception of AI as an academic discipline.[61] It was organized by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, with the support of two senior scientists Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. The proposal for the conference stated they intended to test the assertion that \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[77][d] The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was introduced by John McCarthy at the workshop.[e] The participants included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research.[83][f] At the workshop Newell and Simon debuted the \"Logic Theorist\".[84] The workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first major success and its key players, and is widely considered the birth of AI.[g]\\nCognitive revolution[edit]\\nMain article: cognitive revolution\\nIn the autumn of 1956, Newell and Simon also presented the Logic Theorist at a meeting of the Special Interest Group in Information Theory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At the same meeting, Noam Chomsky discussed his generative grammar, and George Miller described his landmark paper \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\". Miller wrote \"I left the symposium with a conviction, more intuitive than rational, that experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of cognitive processes were all pieces from a larger whole.\"[86][57]\\nThis meeting was the beginning of the \"cognitive revolution\"—an interdisciplinary paradigm shift in psychology, philosophy, computer science and neuroscience. It inspired the creation of the sub-fields of symbolic artificial intelligence, generative linguistics, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience and the philosophical schools of computationalism and functionalism. All these fields used related tools to model the mind and results discovered in one field were relevant to the others.\\nThe cognitive approach allowed researchers to consider \"mental objects\" like thoughts, plans, goals, facts or memories, often analyzed using high level symbols in functional networks. These objects had been forbidden as \"unobservable\" by earlier paradigms such as behaviorism.[h] Symbolic mental objects would become the major focus of AI research and funding for the next several decades.\\nEarly successes (1956-1974)[edit]\\nThe programs developed in the years after the Dartmouth Workshop were, to most people, simply \"astonishing\":[i] computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such \"intelligent\" behavior by machines was possible at all.[90][91][89] Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years.[92] Government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, then known as \"ARPA\") poured money into the field.[93] Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[60]\\nApproaches[edit]\\nThere were many successful programs and new directions in the late 50s and 1960s. Among the most influential were these:\\nReasoning, planning and problem solving as search[edit]\\nMany early AI programs used the same basic algorithm. To achieve some goal (like winning a game or proving a theorem), they proceeded step by step towards it (by making a move or a deduction) as if searching through a maze, backtracking whenever they reached a dead end.[94] The principal difficulty was that, for many problems, the number of possible paths through the \"maze\" was astronomical (a situation known as a \"combinatorial explosion\"). Researchers would reduce the search space by using heuristics that would eliminate paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution.[95]\\nNewell and Simon tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the \"General Problem Solver\".[96][97] Other \"searching\" programs were able to accomplish impressive tasks like solving problems in geometry and algebra, such as Herbert Gelernter\\'s Geometry Theorem Prover (1958)[98] and Symbolic Automatic Integrator (SAINT), written by Minsky\\'s student James Slagle in 1961.[99][100] Other programs searched through goals and subgoals to plan actions, like the STRIPS system developed at Stanford to control the behavior of the robot Shakey.[101]\\nNatural language[edit]\\nAn example of a semantic network\\nAn important goal of AI research is to allow computers to communicate in natural languages like English. An early success was Daniel Bobrow\\'s program STUDENT, which could solve high school algebra word problems.[102]\\nA semantic net represents concepts (e.g. \"house\", \"door\") as nodes, and relations among concepts as links between the nodes (e.g. \"has-a\"). The first AI program to use a semantic net was written by Ross Quillian[103] and the most successful (and controversial) version was Roger Schank\\'s Conceptual dependency theory.[104]\\nJoseph Weizenbaum\\'s ELIZA could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not a computer program (see ELIZA effect). But in fact, ELIZA simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to it, rephrasing its response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatbot.[105][106]\\nMicro-worlds[edit]\\nIn the late 60s, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that AI research should focus on artificially simple situations known as micro-worlds.[j] They pointed out that in successful sciences like physics, basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies. Much of the research focused on a \"blocks world,\" which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface.[107]\\nThis paradigm led to innovative work in machine vision by Gerald Sussman, Adolfo Guzman, David Waltz (who invented \"constraint propagation\"), and especially Patrick Winston. At the same time, Minsky and Papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks, bringing the blocks world to life. Terry Winograd\\'s SHRDLU could communicate in ordinary English sentences about the micro-world, plan operations and execute them.[107]\\nPerceptrons and early neural networks[edit]\\nMain article: Perceptron\\nIn the 1960s funding was primarily directed towards laboratories researching symbolic AI, however several people still pursued research in neural networks.\\nThe Mark 1 Perceptron.\\nThe perceptron, a single-layer neural network was introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt[108] (who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science).[109] Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that a perceptron \"may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages.\"[110] Rosenblatt was primarily funded by Office of Naval Research.[111]\\nBernard Widrow and his student Ted Hoff built ADALINE (1960) and MADALINE (1962), which had up to 1000 adjustable weights.[112][113] A group at Stanford Research Institute led by Charles A. Rosen and Alfred E. (Ted) Brain built two neural network machines named MINOS I (1960) and II (1963), mainly funded by U.S. Army Signal Corps. MINOS II[114] had 6600 adjustable weights,[115] and was controlled with an SDS 910 computer in a configuration named MINOS III (1968), which could classify symbols on army maps, and recognize hand-printed characters on Fortran coding sheets.[116][117] Most of neural network research during this early period involved building and using bespoke hardware, rather than simulation on digital computers.[k]\\nHowever, partly due to lack of results and partly due to competition from symbolic AI research, the MINOS project ran out of funding in 1966. Rosenblatt failed to secure continued funding in the 1960s.[118] In 1969, research came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert\\'s 1969 book Perceptrons.[119] It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Rosenblatt\\'s predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was that virtually no research was funded in connectionism for 10 years.[120] The competition for government funding ended with the victory of symbolic AI approaches over neural networks.[117][118]\\nMinsky (who had worked on SNARC) became a staunch objector to pure connectionist AI. Widrow (who had worked on ADALINE) turned to adaptive signal processing. The SRI group (which worked on MINOS) turned to symbolic AI and robotics.[117][118]\\nThe main problem was the inability to train multilayered networks (versions of backpropagation had already been used in other fields but it was unknown to these researchers).[121][120] The AI community became aware of backpropogation in the 80s,[122] and, in the 21st century, neural networks would become enormously successful, fulfilling all of Rosenblatt\\'s optimistic predictions. Rosenblatt did not live to see this, however, as he died in a boating accident in 1971.[123]\\nOptimism[edit]\\nThe first generation of AI researchers made these predictions about their work:\\n1958, H. A. Simon and Allen Newell: \"within ten years a digital computer will be the world\\'s chess champion\" and \"within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem.\"[124]\\n1965, H. A. Simon: \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.\"[125]\\n1967, Marvin Minsky: \"Within a generation... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved.\"[126]\\n1970, Marvin Minsky (in Life magazine): \"In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.\"[127][l]\\nFinancing[edit]\\nIn June 1963, MIT received a $2.2 million grant from the newly created Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later known as DARPA). The money was used to fund project MAC which subsumed the \"AI Group\" founded by Minsky and McCarthy five years earlier. DARPA continued to provide $3 million each year until the 70s.[130] DARPA made similar grants to Newell and Simon\\'s program at Carnegie Mellon University and to Stanford University\\'s AI Lab, founded by John McCarthy in 1963.[131] Another important AI laboratory was established at Edinburgh University by Donald Michie in 1965.[132] These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research and funding in academia for many years.[133][m]\\nThe money was given with few strings attached: J. C. R. Licklider, then the director of ARPA, believed that his organization should \"fund people, not projects!\" and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them.[135] This created a freewheeling atmosphere at MIT that gave birth to the hacker culture,[136] but this \"hands off\" approach did not last.\\nFirst AI Winter (1974–1980)[edit]\\nIn the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised public expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding targeted at AI was severely reduced.[137] The lack of success indicated the techniques being used by AI researchers at the time were insufficient to achieve their goals.[138][139]\\nThese setbacks did not affect the growth and progress of the field, however. The funding cuts only impacted a handful of major laboratories[140] and the critiques were largely ignored.[141] General public interest in the field continued to grow,[140] the number of researchers increased dramatically,[140] and new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas. Historian Thomas Haigh argued in 2023 that there was no winter,[140] and AI researcher Nils Nilsson described this period as the most \"exciting\" time to work in AI.[142]\\nProblems[edit]\\nIn the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve;[n] all the programs were, in some sense, \"toys\".[144] AI researchers had begun to run into several limits that would be only conquered decades later, and others that still stymie the field in the 2020s:\\nLimited computer power: There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful.[o] For example: Ross Quillian\\'s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only 20 words, because that was all that would fit in memory.[146] Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it\\'s impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. \"With enough horsepower,\" he wrote, \"anything will fly\".[147][p]\\nIntractability and the combinatorial explosion: In 1972 Richard Karp (building on Stephen Cook\\'s 1971 theorem) showed there are many problems that can only be solved in exponential time. Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires extraordinary amounts of computer time, except when the problems are trivial. This limitation applied to all symbolic AI programs that used search trees and meant that many of the \"toy\" solutions used by AI would never scale to useful systems.[143][139]\\nMoravec\\'s paradox: Early AI research had been very successful at getting computers to do \"intelligent\" tasks like proving theorems, solving geometry problems and playing chess. Their success at these intelligent tasks convinced them that the problem of intelligent behavior had been largely solved.[149][150] However, they utterly failed to make progress on \"unintelligent\" tasks like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything.[149][151] By the 1980s, researchers would realize that symbolic reasoning was utterly unsuited for these perceptual and sensorimotor tasks and that there were limits to this approach.[150]\\nThe breadth of commonsense knowledge: Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require enormous amounts of information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a vast amount of information with billions of atomic facts. No one in 1970 could build a database large enough and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.[152]\\nRepresenting commonsense reasoning: A number of related problems[q] appeared when researchers tried to represent commonsense reasoning using formal logic or symbols. Descriptions of very ordinary deductions tended to get longer and longer the more one worked on them, as more and more exceptions, clarifications and distinctions were required.[r] However, when people thought about ordinary concepts they did not rely on precise definitions, rather they seemed to make hundreds of imprecise assumptions, correcting them when necessary using their entire body of commonsense knowledge. Gerald Sussman observed that \"using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn\\'t make them any more precise.\"[153]\\nDecrease in funding[edit]\\nSee also: AI winter\\nThe agencies which funded AI research, such as the British government, DARPA and the National Research Council (NRC) became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected AI research. The pattern began in 1966 when the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report criticized machine translation efforts. After spending $20 million, the NRC ended all support.[154] In 1973, the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in the UK criticized the failure of AI to achieve its \"grandiose objectives\" and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country.[155] (The report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for AI\\'s failings.)[139][143][s] DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of $3 million.[157][t]\\nHans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues. \"Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration.\"[158][u] However, there was another issue: since the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under increasing pressure to fund \"mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research\". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA, which instead directed money at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems.[159][v]\\nThe major laboratories (MIT, Stanford, CMU and Edinburgh) had been receiving generous support from their governments, and when it was withdrawn, these were the only places that were seriously impacted by the budget cuts. The thousands of researchers outside these institutions and the many more thousands that were joining the field were unaffected.[140]\\nPhilosophical and ethical critiques[edit]\\nSee also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\\nSeveral philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas, who argued that Gödel\\'s incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could.[161] Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little \"symbol processing\" and a great deal of embodied, instinctive, unconscious \"know how\".[w][163] John Searle\\'s Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to \"understand\" the symbols that it uses (a quality called \"intentionality\"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as \"thinking\".[164]\\nThese critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers. Problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference \"know how\" or \"intentionality\" made to an actual computer program. MIT\\'s Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle \"they misunderstand, and should be ignored.\"[165] Dreyfus, who also taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\"[166] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, was also an outspoken critic of Dreyfus\\' positions, but he \"deliberately made it plain that [his AI colleagues\\' treatment of Dreyfus] was not the way to treat a human being,\"[x] and was unprofessional and childish.[168]\\nWeizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote a \"computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue\" based on ELIZA.[169][170][y] Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life.[172]\\nLogic at Stanford, CMU and Edinburgh[edit]\\nLogic was introduced into AI research as early as 1958, by John McCarthy in his Advice Taker proposal.[173][98] In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm.[98] However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 1960s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems.[173][174] A more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel\\xa0[fr] who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.[175] Prolog uses a subset of logic (Horn clauses, closely related to \"rules\" and \"production rules\") that permit tractable computation. Rules would continue to be influential, providing a foundation for Edward Feigenbaum\\'s expert systems and the continuing work by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon that would lead to Soar and their unified theories of cognition.[176]\\nCritics of the logical approach noted, as Dreyfus had, that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason, Eleanor Rosch, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof.[z] McCarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant. He argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.[aa]\\nMIT\\'s \"anti-logic\" approach[edit]\\nAmong the critics of McCarthy\\'s approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like \"story understanding\" and \"object recognition\" that required a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like \"chair\" or \"restaurant\" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. MIT chose instead to focus on writing programs that solved a given task without using high-level abstract definitions or general theories of cognition, and measured performance by iterative testing, rather than arguments from first principles. Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as scruffy, as opposed to the neat paradigm used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.[177][ab]\\nIn 1975, in a seminal paper, Minsky noted that many of his fellow researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on (none of which are true for all birds). Minsky associated these assumptions with the general category and they could be inherited by the frames for subcategories and individuals, or over-ridden as necessary. He called these structures frames. Schank used a version of frames he called \"scripts\" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.[178] Frames would eventually be widely used in software engineering under the name object-oriented programming.\\nThe logicians rose to the challenge. Pat Hayes claimed that \"most of \\'frames\\' is just a new syntax for parts of first-order logic.\" But he noted that \"there are one or two apparently minor details which give a lot of trouble, however, especially defaults\".[179]\\nRay Reiter admitted that \"conventional logics, such as first-order logic, lack the expressive power to adequately represent the knowledge required for reasoning by default\".[180] He proposed augmenting first-order logic with a closed world assumption that a conclusion holds (by default) if its contrary cannot be shown. He showed how such an assumption corresponds to the common sense assumption made in reasoning with frames. He also showed that it has its \"procedural equivalent\" as negation as failure in Prolog. The closed world assumption, as formulated by Reiter, \"is not a first-order notion. (It is a meta notion.)\"[180] However, Keith Clark showed that negation as finite failure can be understood as reasoning implicitly with definitions in first-order logic including a unique name assumption that different terms denote different individuals.[181]\\nDuring the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, a variety of logics and extensions of first-order logic were developed both for negation as failure in logic programming and for default reasoning more generally. Collectively, these logics have become known as non-monotonic logics.\\nBoom (1980–1987)[edit]\\nIn the 1980s, a form of AI program called \"expert systems\" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. Governments provided substantial funding, such as Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project and the U.S. Strategic Computing Initiative. \"Overall, the AI industry boomed from a few million dollars in 1980 to billions of dollars in 1988.\"[122]\\nExpert systems become widely used[edit]\\nAn expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts.[182] The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings.[183][120] MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases.[122] They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.\\nExpert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem)[120] and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point.[184]\\nIn 1980, an expert system called R1 was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation. It was an enormous success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986.[185] Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments.[186] An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.[187]\\nGovernment funding increases[edit]\\nIn 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings.[188] Much to the chagrin of scruffies, they initially chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project.[189]\\nOther countries responded with new programs of their own. The UK began the £350 million Alvey project.[190] A consortium of American companies formed the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (or \"MCC\") to fund large scale projects in AI and information technology.[191][190] DARPA responded as well, founding the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988.[192][193]\\nKnowledge revolution[edit]\\nThe power of expert systems came from the expert knowledge they contained. They were part of a new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s. \"AI researchers were beginning to suspect—reluctantly, for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony—that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways,\"[194] writes Pamela McCorduck. \"[T]he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge, sometimes quite detailed knowledge, of a domain where a given task lay\".[195] Knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of AI research in the 1980s.[196] It was hoped that vast databases would solve the commonsense knowledge problem and provide the support that commonsense reasoning required.\\nIn the 1980s some researchers attempted to attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started a database called Cyc, argued that there is no shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand.[197]\\nNew directions in the 1980s[edit]\\nAlthough symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning produced useful applications in the 80s and received massive amounts of funding, it was still unable to solve problems in perception, robotics, learning and common sense. A small number of scientists and engineers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would ever be sufficient for these tasks and developed other approaches, such as \"connectionism\", robotics, \"soft\" computing and reinforcement learning. Nils Nilsson called these approaches \"sub-symbolic\".\\nRevival of neural networks: \"connectionism\"[edit]\\nA Hopfield net with four nodes\\nIn 1982, physicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a \"Hopfield net\") could learn and process information, and provably converges after enough time under any fixed condition. It was a breakthrough, as it was previously thought that nonlinear networks would, in general, evolve chaotically.[198] Around the same time, Geoffrey Hinton and David Rumelhart popularized a method for training neural networks called \"backpropagation\".[ac] These two developments helped to revive the exploration of artificial neural networks.[122][199]\\nNeural networks, along with several other similar models, received widespread attention after the 1986 publication of the Parallel Distributed Processing, a two volume collection of papers edited by Rumelhart and psychologist James McClelland. The new field was christened \"connectionism\" and there was a considerable debate between advocates of symbolic AI and the \"connectionists\".[122] Hinton called symbols the \"luminous aether of AI\" – that is, an unworkable and misleading model of intelligence.[122] This was a direct attack on the principles that inspired the cognitive revolution.\\nIn 1990, Yann LeCun at Bell Labs used convolutional neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. The system was used widely in 90s, reading zip codes and personal checks. This was the first genuinely useful application of neural networks.[200][201]\\nRobotics and embodied reason[edit]\\nMain articles: Nouvelle AI, behavior-based AI, situated AI, and embodied cognitive science\\nRodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and others argued that, in order to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a body — it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world.[202] Sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills such as commonsense reasoning. They can\\'t be efficiently implemented using abstract symbolic reasoning, so AI should solve the problems of perception, mobility, manipulation and survival without using symbolic representation at all. These robotics researchers advocated building intelligence \"from the bottom up\".[ad]\\nA precursor to this idea was David Marr, who had come to MIT in the late 1970s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision. He rejected all symbolic approaches (both McCarthy\\'s logic and Minsky\\'s frames), arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. (Marr\\'s work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980.)[204]\\nIn his 1990 paper \"Elephants Don\\'t Play Chess,\"[205] robotics researcher Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since \"the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough.\"[206]\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the \"embodied mind thesis\".[207]\\nSoft computing and probabilistic reasoning[edit]\\nSoft computing uses methods that work with incomplete and imprecise information. They do not attempt to give precise, logical answers, but give results that are only \"probably\" correct. This allowed them to solve problems that precise symbolic methods could not handle. Press accounts often claimed these tools could \"think like a human\".[208][209]\\nJudea Pearl\\'s Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference, an influential 1988 book[210] brought probability and decision theory into AI.[211] Fuzzy logic, developed by Lofti Zadeh in the 60s, began to be more widely used in AI and robotics. Evolutionary computation and artificial neural networks also handle imprecise information, and are classified as \"soft\". In the 90s and early 2000s many other soft computing tools were developed and put into use, including Bayesian networks,[211] hidden Markov models,[211] information theory and stochastic modeling. These tools in turn depended on advanced mathematical techniques such as classical optimization. For a time in the 1990s and early 2000s, these soft tools were studied by a subfield of AI called \"computational intelligence\".[212]\\nReinforcement learning[edit]\\nReinforcement learning[213] gives an agent a reward every time it performs a desired action well, and may give negative rewards (or \"punishments\") when it performs poorly. It was described in the first half of the twentieth century by psychologists using animal models, such as Thorndike,[214][215] Pavlov[216] and Skinner.[217] In the 1950s, Alan Turing[215][218] and Arthur Samuel[215] foresaw the role of reinforcement learning in AI.\\nA successful and influential research program was led by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto beginning 1972. Their collaboration revolutionized the study of reinforcement learning and decision making over the four decades.[219][220] In 1988, Sutton described machine learning in terms of decision theory (i.e., the Markov decision process). This gave the subject a solid theoretical foundation and access to a large body of theoretical results developed in the field of operations research.[220]\\nAlso in 1988, Sutton and Barto developed the \"temporal difference\" (TD) learning algorithm, where the agent is rewarded only when its predictions about the future show improvement. It significantly outperformed previous algorithms.[221] TD-learning was used by Gerald Tesauro in 1992 in the program TD-Gammon, which played backgammon as well as the best human players. The program learned the game by playing against itself with zero prior knowledge.[222] In an interesting case of interdisciplinary convergence, neurologists discovered in 1997 that the dopamine reward system in brains also uses a version of the TD-learning algorithm.[223][224][225] TD learning would be become highly influential in the 21st century, used in both AlphaGo and AlphaZero.[226]\\nSecond AI winter[edit]\\nThe business community\\'s fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. As dozens of companies failed, the perception in the business world was that the technology was not viable.[227] The damage to AI\\'s reputation would last into the 21st century. Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI\\'s failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of \"artificial intelligence\".[228]\\nOver the next 20 years, AI consistently delivered working solutions to specific isolated problems. By the late 1990s, it was being used throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. The success was due to increasing computer power, by collaboration with other fields (such as mathematical optimization and statistics) and using the highest standards of scientific accountability. By 2000, AI had achieved some of its oldest goals. The field was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been.\\nAI winter[edit]\\nThe term \"AI winter\" was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of 1974 when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment would certainly follow.[ae] Their fears were well founded: in the late 1980s and early 1990s, AI suffered a series of financial setbacks.[122]\\nThe first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.[230]\\nEventually the earliest successful expert systems, such as XCON, proved too expensive to maintain. They were difficult to update, they could not learn, and they were \"brittle\" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs). Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts.[231]\\nIn the late 1980s, the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI \"deeply and brutally\". New leadership at DARPA had decided that AI was not \"the next wave\" and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results.[232]\\nBy 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 for Japan\\'s Fifth Generation Project had not been met. Indeed, some of them, like \"carry on a casual conversation\" would not be accomplished for another 40 years. As with other AI projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible.[233][af]\\nOver 300 AI companies had shut down, gone bankrupt, or been acquired by the end of 1993, effectively ending the first commercial wave of AI.[235] In 1994, HP Newquist stated in The Brain Makers that \"The immediate future of artificial intelligence—in its commercial form—seems to rest in part on the continued success of neural networks.\"[235]\\nAI behind the scenes[edit]\\nIn the 1990s, algorithms originally developed by AI researchers began to appear as parts of larger systems. AI had solved a lot of very difficult problems[ag] and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry,[236][237] such as data mining, industrial robotics, logistics, speech recognition,[238] banking software,[239] medical diagnosis[239] and Google\\'s search engine.[240][241]\\nThe field of AI received little or no credit for these successes in the 1990s and early 2000s. Many of AI\\'s greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science.[242] Nick Bostrom explains: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[239]\\nMany researchers in AI in the 1990s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, knowledge-based systems, \"cognitive systems\" or computational intelligence. In part, this may have been because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI, but also the new names help to procure funding.[238][243][244] In the commercial world at least, the failed promises of the AI Winter continued to haunt AI research into the 2000s, as the New York Times reported in 2005: \"Computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers.\"[245]\\nMathematical rigor, greater collaboration and a narrow focus[edit]\\nAI researchers began to develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past.[246][247] Most of the new directions in AI relied heavily on mathematical models, including artificial neural networks, probabilistic reasoning, soft computing and reinforcement learning. In the 90s and 2000s, many other highly mathematical tools were adapted for AI. These tools were applied to machine learning, perception and mobility.\\nThere was a widespread realization that many of the problems that AI needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like statistics, mathematics, electrical engineering, economics or operations research. The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable; AI had become a more rigorous \"scientific\" discipline.\\nAnother key reason for the success in the 90s was that AI researchers focussed on specific problems with verifiable solutions (an approach later derided as narrow AI). This provided useful tools in the present, rather than speculation about the future.\\nIntelligent agents[edit]\\nA new paradigm called \"intelligent agents\" became widely accepted during the 1990s.[248][249][ah] Although earlier researchers had proposed modular \"divide and conquer\" approaches to AI,[ai] the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until Judea Pearl, Allen Newell, Leslie P. Kaelbling, and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of AI.[250] When the economist\\'s definition of a rational agent was married to computer science\\'s definition of an object or module, the intelligent agent paradigm was complete.\\nAn intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are \"intelligent agents\", as are human beings and organizations of human beings, such as firms. The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as \"the study of intelligent agents\".[aj] This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI: it goes beyond studying human intelligence; it studies all kinds of intelligence.\\nThe paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and to disagree about methods, but still retain hope that their work could be combined into an agent architecture that would be capable of general intelligence.[251]\\nMilestones and Moore\\'s law[edit]\\nOn May 11, 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.[252] In 2005, a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail. Two years later, a team from CMU won the DARPA Urban Challenge by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an urban environment while responding to traffic hazards and adhering to traffic laws.[253]\\nThese successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm, but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous increase in the speed and capacity of computers by the 90s.[ak] In fact, Deep Blue\\'s computer was 10 million times faster than the Ferranti Mark 1 that Christopher Strachey taught to play chess in 1951.[al] This dramatic increase is measured by Moore\\'s law, which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years. The fundamental problem of \"raw computer power\" was slowly being overcome.\\nBig data, deep learning, AGI (2005–2017)[edit]\\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as \"big data\"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. A turning point was the success of deep learning around 2012 which improved the performance of machine learning on many tasks, including image and video processing, text analysis, and speech recognition.[255] Investment in AI increased along with its capabilities, and by 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than $8 billion, and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a \"frenzy\".[256]\\nIn 2002, Ben Goertzel and others became concerned that AI had largely abandoned its original goal of producing versatile, fully intelligent machines, and argued in favor of more direct research into artificial general intelligence. By the mid-2010s several companies and institutions had been founded to pursue Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), such as OpenAI and Google\\'s DeepMind. During the same period, new insights into superintelligence raised concerns that AI was an existential threat. The risks and unintended consequences of AI technology became an area of serious academic research after 2016.\\nBig data and big machines[edit]\\nSee also: List of datasets for machine-learning research\\nThe success of machine learning in the 2000s depended on the availability of vast amounts of training data and faster computers.[257] Russell and Norvig wrote that the \"improvement in performance obtained by increasing the size of the data set by two or three orders of magnitude outweighs any improvement that can be made by tweaking the algorithm.\"[200] Geoffrey Hinton recalled that back in the 90s, the problem was that \"our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow.\"[258] This was no longer true by 2010.\\nThe most useful data in the 2000s came from curated, labeled data sets created specifically for machine learning and AI. In 2007, a group at UMass Amherst released Labeled Faces in the Wild, an annotated set of images of faces that was widely used to train and test face recognition systems for the next several decades.[259] Fei-Fei Li developed ImageNet, a database of three million images captioned by volunteers using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Released in 2009, it was a useful body of training data and a benchmark for testing for the next generation of image processing systems.[260][200] Google released word2vec in 2013 as an open source resource. It used large amounts of data text scraped from the internet and word embedding to create a numeric vector to represent each word. Users were surprised at how well it was able to capture word meanings, for example, ordinary vector addition would give equivalences like China + River = Yangtze, London+England-France = Paris.[261] This database in particular would be essential for the development of large language models in the late 2010s.\\nThe explosive growth of the internet gave machine learning programs access to billions of pages of text and images that could be scraped. And, for specific problems, large privately held databases contained the relevant data. McKinsey Global Institute reported that \"by 2009, nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data\".[262] This collection of information was known in the 2000s as big data.\\nIn a Jeopardy! exhibition match in February 2011, IBM\\'s question answering system Watson defeated the two best Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[263] Watson\\'s expertise would have been impossible without the information available on the internet.[200]\\nDeep learning[edit]\\nMain article: Deep learning\\nIn 2012, AlexNet, a deep learning model,[am] developed by Alex Krizhevsky, won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, with significantly fewer errors than the second-place winner.[265][200] Krizhevsky worked with Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.[an] This was a turning point in machine learning: over the next few years dozens of other approaches to image recognition were abandoned in favor of deep learning.[257]\\nDeep learning uses a multi-layer perceptron. Although this architecture has been known since the 60s, getting it to work requires powerful hardware and large amounts of training data.[266] Before these became available, improving performance of image processing systems required hand-crafted ad hoc features that were difficult to implement.[266] Deep learning was simpler and more general.[ao]\\nDeep learning was applied to dozens of problems over the next few years (such as speech recognition, machine translation, medical diagnosis, and game playing). In every case it showed enormous gains in performance.[257] Investment and interest in AI boomed as a result.[257]\\nThe alignment problem[edit]\\nIt became fashionable in the 2000s to begin talking about the future of AI again and several popular books considered the possibility of superintelligent machines and what they might mean for human society. Some of this was optimistic (such as Ray Kurzweil\\'s The Singularity is Near), but others warned that a sufficiently powerful AI was existential threat to humanity, such as Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky.[267] The topic became widely covered in the press and many leading intellectuals and politicians commented on the issue.\\nAI programs in the 21st century are defined by their goals – the specific measures that they are designed to optimize. Nick Bostrom\\'s influential 2005 book Superintelligence argued that, if one isn\\'t careful about defining these goals, the machine may cause harm to humanity in the process of achieving a goal. Stuart J. Russell used the example of an intelligent robot that kills its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead\".[268] (This problem is known by the technical term \"instrumental convergence\".) The solution is to align the machine\\'s goal function with the goals of its owner and humanity in general. Thus, the problem of mitigating the risks and unintended consequences of AI became known as \"the value alignment problem\" or AI alignment.[269]\\nAt the same time, machine learning systems had begun to have disturbing unintended consequences. Cathy O\\'Neil explained how statistical algorithms had been among the causes of the 2008 economic crash,[270] Julia Angwin of ProPublica argued that the COMPAS system used by the criminal justice system exhibited racial bias under some measures,[271][ap] others showed that many machine learning systems exhibited some form of racial bias,[273] and there were many other examples of dangerous outcomes that had resulted from machine learning systems.[aq]\\nIn 2016, the election of Donald Trump and the controversy over the COMPAS system illuminated several problems with the current technological infrastructure, including misinformation, social media algorithms designed to maximize engagement, the misuse of personal data and the trustworthiness of predictive models.[274] Issues of fairness and unintended consequences became significantly more popular at AI conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The value alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[275][ar]\\nArtificial general intelligence research[edit]\\nIn the early 2000s, several researchers became concerned that mainstream AI was too focused on \"measurable performance in specific applications\"[277] (known as \"narrow AI\") and had abandoned AI\\'s original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. An early critic was Nils Nilsson in 1995, and similar opinions were published by AI elder statesmen John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Patrick Winston in 2007–2009. Minsky organized a symposium on \"human-level AI\" in 2004.[277] Ben Goertzel adopted the term \"artificial general intelligence\" for the new sub-field, founding a journal and holding conferences beginning in 2008.[278] The new field grew rapidly, buoyed by the continuing success of artificial neural networks and the hope that it was the key to AGI.\\nSeveral competing companies, laboratories and foundations were founded to develop AGI in the 2010s. DeepMind was founded in 2010 by three English scientists, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman, with funding from Peter Thiel and later Elon Musk. The founders and financiers were deeply concerned about AI safety and the existential risk of AI. DeepMind\\'s founders had a personal connection with Yudkowsky and Musk was among those who was actively raising the alarm.[279] Hassabis was both worried about the dangers of AGI and optimistic about its power; he hoped they could \"solve AI, then solve everything else.\"[280] The New York Times wrote in 2023 \"At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth.\"[279]\\nIn 2012, Geoffrey Hinton (who been leading neural network research since the 80s) was approached by Baidu, which wanted to hire him and all his students for an enormous sum. Hinton decided to hold an auction and, at a Lake Tahoe AI conference, they sold themselves to Google for a price of $44 million. Hassabis took notice and sold DeepMind to Google in 2014, on the condition that it would not accept military contracts and would be overseen by an ethics board.[279]\\nLarry Page of Google, unlike Musk and Hassabis, was an optimist about the future of AI. Musk and Paige became embroiled in an argument about the risk of AGI at Musk\\'s 2015 birthday party. They had been friends for decades but stopped speaking to each other shortly afterwards. Musk attended the one and only meeting of the DeepMind\\'s ethics board, where it became clear that Google was uninterested in mitigating the harm of AGI. Frustrated by his lack of influence he founded OpenAI in 2015, enlisting Sam Altman to run it and hiring top scientists. OpenAI began as a non-profit, \"free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations.\"[279] Musk became frustrated again and left the company in 2018. OpenAI turned to Microsoft for continued financial support and Altman and OpenAI formed a for-profit version of the company with more than $1 billion in financing.[279]\\nIn 2021, Dario Amodei and 14 other scientists left OpenAI over concerns that the company was putting profits above safety. They formed Anthropic, which soon had $6 billion in financing from Microsoft and Google.[279]\\nLarge language models, AI boom (2020–present)[edit]\\nMain article: AI boom\\nThe AI boom started with the initial development of key architectures and algorithms such as the transformer architecture in 2017, leading to the scaling and development of large language models exhibiting human-like traits of knowledge, attention and creativity. The new AI era began since 2020, with the public release of scaled large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.[281]\\nTransformer architecture and large language models[edit]\\nMain article: Large language models\\nIn 2017, the transformer architecture was proposed by Google researchers. It exploits an attention mechanism and became widely used in large language models.[282]\\nLarge language models, based on the transformer, were developed by AGI companies: OpenAI released GPT-3 in 2020, and DeepMind released Gato in 2022. These are foundation models: they are trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.[citation needed]\\nThese models can discuss a huge number of topics and display general knowledge. The question naturally arises: are these models an example of artificial general intelligence? Bill Gates was skeptical of the new technology and the hype that surrounded AGI. However, Altman presented him with a live demo of ChatGPT4 passing an advanced biology test. Gates was convinced.[279] In 2023, Microsoft Research tested the model with a large variety of tasks, and concluded that \"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\".[283]\\nIn 2024, OpenAI o3, a type of advanced reasoning model developed by OpenAI was announced. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark developed by François Chollet in 2019, the model achieved an unofficial score of 87.5% on the semi-private test, surpassing the typical human score of 84%. The benchmark is supposed to be a necessary, but not sufficient test for AGI. Speaking of the benchmark, Chollet has said \"You’ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.\"[284]\\nAI boom[edit]\\nMain article: AI boom\\nInvestment in AI grew exponentially after 2020, with venture capital funding for generative AI companies increasing dramatically. Total AI investments rose from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021, with generative AI accounting for approximately 30% of investments by 2023.[285] According to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranked the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, number of startups, and AI patents granted.[286] The commercial AI scene became dominated by American Big Tech companies, whose investments in this area surpassed those from U.S.-based venture capitalists.[287] OpenAI\\'s valuation reached $86 billion by early 2024,[288] while NVIDIA\\'s market capitalization surpassed $3.3 trillion by mid-2024, making it the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization as the demand for AI-capable GPUs surged.[289]\\n15.ai, launched in March 2020[290] by an anonymous MIT researcher,[291][292] was one of the earliest examples of generative AI gaining widespread public attention during the initial stages of the AI boom.[293] The free web application demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using neural networks with minimal training data, requiring as little as 15 seconds of audio to reproduce a voice—a capability later corroborated by OpenAI in 2024.[294] The service went viral on social media platforms in early 2021,[295][296] allowing users to generate speech for characters from popular media franchises, and became particularly notable for its pioneering role in popularizing AI voice synthesis for creative content and memes.[297]\\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system’s potential effects. OpenAI’s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that \"At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.\" We agree. That point is now.\\nTherefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.\\nPause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter[298]\\nAdvent of AI for public use[edit]\\nChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, marking a pivotal moment in artificial intelligence\\'s public adoption. Within days of its release it went viral, gaining over 100 million users in two months and becoming the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.[299] The chatbot\\'s ability to engage in human-like conversations, write code, and generate creative content captured public imagination and led to rapid adoption across various sectors including education, business, and research.[300] ChatGPT\\'s success prompted unprecedented responses from major technology companies—Google declared a \"code red\" and rapidly launched Gemini (formerly known as Google Bard), while Microsoft incorporated the technology into Bing Chat.[301]\\nThe rapid adoption of these AI technologies sparked intense debate about their implications. Notable AI researchers and industry leaders voiced both optimism and concern about the accelerating pace of development. In March 2023, over 20,000 signatories, including computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, Elon Musk, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, signed an open letter calling for a pause in advanced AI development, citing \"profound risks to society and humanity.\"[302] However, other prominent researchers like Juergen Schmidhuber took a more optimistic view, emphasizing that the majority of AI research aims to make \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[303]\\nBy mid-2024, however, the financial sector began to scrutinize AI companies more closely, particularly questioning their capacity to produce a return on investment commensurate with their massive valuations. Some prominent investors raised concerns about market expectations becoming disconnected from fundamental business realities. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO LLC, warned investors to \"be quite careful\" and drew parallels to previous technology-driven market bubbles.[304] Similarly, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, explicitly compared the AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, suggesting that investor enthusiasm might be outpacing realistic near-term capabilities and revenue potential.[305] These concerns were amplified by the substantial market capitalizations of AI-focused companies, many of which had yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability models.\\nIn March 2024, Anthropic released the Claude 3 family of large language models, including Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus.[306] The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks, with Claude 3 Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google.[307] In June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, particularly in areas such as coding, multistep workflows, and image analysis.[308]\\n2024 Nobel Prizes[edit]\\nIn 2024, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nobel Prizes in recognition of groundbreaking contributions to artificial intelligence. The recipients included:\\nIn physics: John Hopfield for his work on physics-inspired Hopfield networks, and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational contributions to Boltzmann machines and deep learning.\\nIn chemistry: David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for their advancements in protein folding predictions. See AlphaFold. [309]\\nCurrent developments[edit]\\nIn January 2025, OpenAI announced a new AI, ChatGPT-Gov, which would be specifically designed for US government agencies to use securely. [310] Open AI said that agencies could utilize ChatGPT Gov on a Microsoft Azure cloud or Azure Government cloud, \"on top of Microsoft’s Azure’s OpenAI Service.\" OpenAI\\'s announcement stated that \"Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, FedRAMP High). Additionally, we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\"[310]\\nSee also[edit]\\nHistory of artificial neural networks\\nHistory of knowledge representation and reasoning\\nHistory of natural language processing\\nOutline of artificial intelligence\\nProgress in artificial intelligence\\nTimeline of artificial intelligence\\nTimeline of machine learning\\nNotes[edit]\\n^ The Lambda calculus was especially important to AI, since it was an inspiration for Lisp (the most important programming language used in 20th century AI).[46]\\n^ Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI — although it is now lost. His 1950 paper was followed by three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing, the two lectures \\'Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory\\' and \\'Can Digital Computers Think?\\' and the panel discussion \\'Can Automatic Calculating Machines be Said to Think?\\'[60]\\n^ This was an early statement of the philosophical position John Searle would later call the \"Strong AI hypothesis\": that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do.\\n^ Daniel Crevier wrote \"[the proposal] later became known as the \\'physical symbol systems hypothesis\\'\".[78] The physical symbol system hypothesis was articulated and named by Newell and Simon in their paper on GPS.[79] It includes a more specific definition of a \"machine\" as an agent that manipulates symbols.\\n^ \"I won\\'t swear and I hadn\\'t seen it before,\" McCarthy told Pamela McCorduck in 1979.[80] However, McCarthy also stated unequivocally \"I came up with the term\" in a CNET interview.[81] The term was chosen by McCarthy to avoid associations with cybernetics and the influence of Norbert Wiener. \"[O]ne of the reasons for inventing the term \"artificial intelligence\" was to escape association with \"cybernetics\". Its concentration on analog feedback seemed misguided, and I wished to avoid having either to accept Norbert (not Robert) Wiener as a guru or having to argue with him.\".[82]\\n^ Pamela McCorduck discusses how the Dartmouth conference alumni dominated the first two decades of AI research, calling them the \"invisible college\".[83]\\n^ Daniel Crevier wrote \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science.\"[85]\\n^ There were a few psychologists who avoided behaviorism and embraced a cognitive approach before it was fashionable, such as Frederic Bartlett and Kenneth Craig[87]\\n^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything remotely clever.\" [88] AI founder John McCarthy called this the \"Look, Ma, no hands!\" era.[89]\\n^ This avoided the commonsense knowledge problem, discussed below.\\n^ The hardware diversity was particularly clear in the different technologies used in implementing the adjustable weights. The perceptron machines and the SNARC used potentiometers moved by electric motors. ADALINE used memistors adjusted by electroplating, though they also used simulations on an IBM 1620 computer. The MINOS machines used ferrite cores with multiple holes in them that could be individually blocked, with the degree of blockage representing the weights.[118]\\n^ Minsky strongly believes he was misquoted.[128][129]\\n^ McCorduck also notes that funding was mostly under the direction of alumni of the Dartmouth workshop of 1956.[134]\\n^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult tasks.\"[143]\\n^ Bruce Buchanan wrote: \"Early programs were necessarily limited in scope by the size and speed of memory\"[145]\\n^ History would prove Moravec right about applications like computer vision. Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of the human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 1000 million instructions per second (MIPS). In 1976, the fastest supercomputer, the $8 million Cray-1 was only capable of 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer had 1 MIPS. As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS.[148]\\n^ Such as the frame, ramification and qualification problems, as well as the difficulty of default reasoning and word-sense disambiguation.\\n^ Russell and Norvig write: \"[M]any of the concepts we name in language fail, on closer inspection, to have the logically defined necessary and sufficient conditions that early AI researchers hoped to capture in axiomatic form.\"[122]\\n^ John McCarthy wrote in response that \"the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in AI from the beginning\"[156]\\n^ This account is based on Crevier 1993, pp.\\xa0115–116. Other views include McCorduck 2004, pp.\\xa0306–313 and NRC 1999 under \"Success in Speech Recognition\".\\n^ Moravec explains, \"Their initial promises to DARPA had been much too optimistic. Of course, what they delivered stopped considerably short of that. But they felt they couldn\\'t in their next proposal promise less than in the first one, so they promised more.\"[158]\\n^ While the autonomous tank was a failure, the battle management system (called \"DART\") proved to be enormously successful, saving billions in the first Gulf War, repaying the investment and justifying the DARPA\\'s pragmatic policy, at least as far as DARPA was concerned.[160]\\n^ \"Know-how\" is Dreyfus\\' term. Dreyfus makes a distinction between \"knowing how\" and \"knowing that\", a modern version of Heidegger\\'s distinction of ready-to-hand and present-at-hand.[162]\\n^ Weizenbaum said: \"I became the only member of the AI community to be seen eating lunch with Dreyfus. And I deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being.\"[167]\\n^ Colby and his colleagues later also developed chatterbot-like \"computer simulations of paranoid processes (PARRY)\" to \"make intelligible paranoid processes in explicit symbol processing terms.\"[171]\\n^ Wason & Shapiro (1966) showed that people do poorly on completely abstract problems, but if the problem is restated to allow the use of intuitive social intelligence, performance dramatically improves. (See Wason selection task) Kahneman, Slovic & Tversky (1982) have shown that people are terrible at elementary problems that involve uncertain reasoning. (See list of cognitive biases for several examples). Eleanor Rosch\\'s work is described in Lakoff 1987. Kahnmann published a more general theory of symbolic cognition and other kinds of thinking in his book Thinking Fast and Slow (2011)\\n^ An early example of McCarthy\\'s position was in the journal Science where he said \"This is AI, so we don\\'t care if it\\'s psychologically real\" (Kolata 1982), and he recently reiterated his position at the AI@50 conference where he said \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\" (Maker 2006).\\n^ Another aspect of the conflict was called \"the procedural/declarative distinction\" but did not prove to be influential in later AI research.\\n^ Versions of backpropagation had been developed in several fields, most directly as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by Seppo Linnainmaa (1970). It was applied to neural networks in the 1970s by Paul Werbos.[121]\\n^ Hans Moravec wrote: \"I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one date meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real world competence and the commonsense knowledge that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical golden spike is driven uniting the two efforts.\"[203]\\n^ AI winter was first used as the title of a seminar on the subject for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.[229]\\n^ McCorduck writes \"Two and a half decades later, we can see that the Japanese didn\\'t quite meet all of those ambitious goals.\"[234]\\n^ See Applications of artificial intelligence §\\xa0Computer science\\n^ Russell and Norvig wrote \"The whole-agent view is now widely accepted\" [250]\\n^ Carl Hewitt\\'s Actor model anticipated the modern definition of intelligent agents. (Hewitt, Bishop & Steiger 1973) Both John Doyle (Doyle 1983) and Marvin Minsky\\'s popular classic The Society of Mind (Minsky 1986) used the word \"agent\". Other \"modular\" proposals included Rodney Brook\\'s subsumption architecture, object-oriented programming and others.\\n^ This is how the most widely used textbooks of the 21st century define artificial intelligence, such as Russell and Norvig, 2021; Padgham and Winikoff, 2004; Jones, 2007; Poole and Mackworth, 2017.[250]\\n^ Ray Kurzweil wrote that the improvement in computer chess \"is governed only by the brute force expansion of computer hardware.\"[254]\\n^ Cycle time of Ferranti Mark 1 was 1.2\\xa0milliseconds, which is arguably equivalent to about 833\\xa0flops. Deep Blue ran at 11.38\\xa0gigaflops (and this does not even take into account Deep Blue\\'s special-purpose hardware for chess). Very approximately, these differ by a factor of 107.[citation needed]\\n^ AlexNet had 650,000 neurons and trained using ImageNet, augmented with reversed, cropped and tinted images. The model also used Geoffrey Hinton\\'s dropout technique and a rectified linear output function, both relatively new developments at the time.[264]\\n^ Several other laboratories had developed systems that, like AlexNet, used GPU chips and performed nearly as well as AlexNet,[121] but AlexNet proved to be the most influential.\\n^ See History of AI §\\xa0The problems above, where Hans Moravec predicted that raw power would eventually make AI \"easy\".\\n^ Later research showed that there was no way for system to avoid a measurable racist bias -- fixing one form of bias would necessarily introduce another.[272]\\n^ A short summary of topics would include privacy, surveillance, copyright, misinformation and deep fakes, filter bubbles and partisanship, algorithmic bias, misleading results that go undetected without algorithmic transparency, the right to an explanation, misuse of autonomous weapons and technological unemployment. See Artificial intelligence §\\xa0Ethics\\n^ Brian Christian wrote \"ProPublica\\'s study [of COMPAS in 2015] legitimated concepts like fairness as valid topics for research\"[276]\\n^ Kaplan &

The history spans from ancient myths of artificial beings to modern advancements in AI technology. Key milestones include the work of Alan Turing in the 1930s, the establishment of AI as a field in the 1956 Dartmouth workshop, the development of early AI programs in the 1950s and 1960s, the rise and fall of expert systems in the 1980s, and the resurgence of interest in AI with the advent of machine learning and deep learning in the 21st century.\n",

            "I will summarize the key points from the gathered information to provide a concise overview of the history of AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "Final Answer: The history of artificial intelligence (AI) can be traced back to ancient myths and stories of artificial beings. The formal study of AI began in the mid-20th century, particularly with the work of Alan Turing, who introduced concepts such as the Turing Test in 1950. The field was officially founded at the Dartmouth workshop in 1956, where key figures like John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky gathered to discuss the potential of machines to simulate human intelligence.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the following decades, AI research saw significant advancements, including the development of early AI programs capable of playing games like chess and checkers. However, the field faced challenges, leading to periods known as \"AI winters\" in the 1970s and 1990s, where funding and interest waned due to unmet expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "The resurgence of AI began in the 2000s with the rise of machine learning, fueled by increased computational power and the availability of large datasets. The introduction of deep learning techniques in the 2010s, particularly with the transformer architecture, marked a turning point, leading to the development of large language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, AI continues to evolve rapidly, with applications across various sectors, raising both excitement and ethical concerns about its implications for society. The journey of AI reflects a complex interplay of technological advancements, societal expectations, and philosophical debates about the nature of intelligence.\u001b[0m\n",

With some careful planning and preparation, you can create a stylish backsplash that is long-lasting and easy to maintain. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to properly install wallpaper as a backsplash in your home.\\nChoose the Right Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nWhen selecting a wallpaper for a backsplash application, you’ll want to consider:\\n\\nMoisture resistance – Since the backsplash will be installed behind a sink or stove where it will be exposed to moisture, choose a vinyl or paper wallpaper specifically designed for high-humidity areas. Avoid regular paper wallpapers.\\nWashability – Pick a scrubbable and stain-resistant wallpaper, so it will be easy to keep clean.\\nSize of pattern – Smaller scale patterns will be easiest to work with. Large patterns can be tricky to line up.\\nSheen – Consider how the sheen (matte, satin, semi-gloss, etc.) will interact with your lighting. Glossier papers will be easier to wipe clean.\\nAdhesive – For backsplashes, always use a permanent, heavy-duty adhesive to prevent peeling or bubbling.\\nQuantity – Measure to determine how much wallpaper you will need to cover your backsplash area. Don’t forget to account for pattern matching and cutting allowance.\\n\\nPrepare the Surface\\nProper surface prep is crucial for successful wallpaper installation.\\n\\nMake sure the surface is clean, dry, smooth, and free of grease. Fill any cracks or holes with spackle.\\nSand glossy surfaces lightly to “rough up” and improve adhesion.\\nPrime walls before installing the wallpaper, especially if painting previously. Use an interior wallpaper primer or sealer.\\nFor tile backsplashes, scuff the surface with sandpaper so the adhesive adheres well. Clean thoroughly after sanding.\\n\\nPlan the Layout\\n\\nDecide on your starting point based on the pattern size and shape. It often works best to start in a less visible corner.\\nDetermine if you will need to cut any edges to fit your backsplash area cleanly. Plan ahead for straight cuts.\\nMake sure to match patterns from strip to strip. Plan the layout so seams fall between tiles or at grout lines.\\n\\nPrepare the Wallpaper\\n\\nUnroll the wallpaper and allow it to relax according to manufacturer directions, usually 10-20 minutes.\\nUsing a sharp razor blade, straightedge or wallpaper trimmer, neatly trim off the factory edges. Cut wallpaper strips to your desired length.\\nDraw plumb lines on the surface as guides for your first strip. Use a level and pencil.\\n\\nApply Adhesive\\n\\nApply an even coat of heavy-duty wallpaper adhesive directly onto the backsplash surface using a paint roller or wide brush. Don’t get adhesive on the face of the wallpaper.\\nFold book ends of the strips to keep edges clean and prevent sticking during application.\\nAllow adhesive to become tacky according to manufacturer’s directions before applying wallpaper.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion. I love your ideas.\\n\\n\\nStacey — June 7, 2018 @ 1:01 pm Reply\\nLove this!\\n\\n\\nNancy Glad — August 11, 2018 @ 8:16 am Reply\\nMegan, your info is great – many thanks. Any experience or suggestions for using wallpaper for a backsplash? I want to use nautical maps which are just heavy paper. I would probably need to paint with a clear waterproofing product after it is up. I wallpapered a powder room with National Geographic maps and it turned out fantastic but they don’t get splashed with water and the occasional tomato sauce splatter. – Keep up the great work! (Lining drawers with wallpaper is another brillliant idea – thanks)\\n\\n\\nRob — February 13, 2020 @ 7:08 am Reply\\nLove the paper design you chose.\\nI’ve always wanted to use peel & stick wallpaper but have heard horror stories of removal. Don’t be surprised if when removing (because your renting) some of the sheetrock paper comes off as well; meaning now you have to texture in a rental.\\nWondering – was has been your experience removing peel & stick after several years?\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — February 13, 2020 @ 2:26 pm Reply\\nHi Rob,\\nThanks for sharing your thoughts! Personally, I’ve used peel-and-stick wallpaper over and over and over and have NEVER had it ruin the walls…including the hex paper shown in this post (we pulled it down after it being up for 2+ years).\\xa0\\nI do always test any paper before I do a full installation (often leaving a swatch up for a few weeks to make sure there isn’t any long-term damage). The most I’ve had peel-and-stick paper do is pull little specs of paint off, which are easily touched up.\\xa0\\nI have so much faith in it that I now use it more than paint in all of our rentals…which we usually move out of every 2-3 years.\\nHope that encourages you to give it a try!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecky — March 7, 2020 @ 7:50 am Reply\\nDid you apply any kind of water proof coating? I’ve heard of that or covering it with glass or plexiglass. Do you think that would be necessary?\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — March 7, 2020 @ 8:11 am Reply\\nHi Becky!\\nNo, I don’t think that’s necessary at all. At least not for the paper we used. Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean. I would just be sure not to pick a fabric-like wallpaper or one with texture, although even some of those would likely be fine. Wallpaper is much more durable than people think!\\nHope that helps!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVanessa — April 8, 2020 @ 11:41 am Reply\\nI love this! Such a great idea. Love your blog! So helpful and great ideas.\\nI can *almost* do this except for having textured walls and living in FL – humidity may make wallpaper not stick to it.\\nWe have a galley kitchen so already no counter space but need something waterproof over the sink. Wall-mounted dish rack is the only way to deal w no counter space. But you would still see the wallpaper behind it.\\nDo you happen to know of a very affordable product or treatment I can use over wallpaper that is waterproof & washable?\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — April 10, 2020 @ 9:29 am Reply\\nHi Vanessa,\\nFirst – make sure you check on my wallpaper on textured walls post here:\\nSecond, in my experience, I have never had wallpaper fall down, bubble or peel up. And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion. I love your ideas.\\n\\n\\nStacey — June 7, 2018 @ 1:01 pm Reply\\nLove this!\\n\\n\\nNancy Glad — August 11, 2018 @ 8:16 am Reply\\nMegan, your info is great – many thanks. Any experience or suggestions for using wallpaper for a backsplash? I want to use nautical maps which are just heavy paper. I would probably need to paint with a clear waterproofing product after it is up. I wallpapered a powder room with National Geographic maps and it turned out fantastic but they don’t get splashed with water and the occasional tomato sauce splatter. – Keep up the great work! (Lining drawers with wallpaper is another brillliant idea – thanks)\\n\\n\\nRob — February 13, 2020 @ 7:08 am Reply\\nLove the paper design you chose.\\nI’ve always wanted to use peel & stick wallpaper but have heard horror stories of removal. Don’t be surprised if when removing (because your renting) some of the sheetrock paper comes off as well; meaning now you have to texture in a rental.\\nWondering – was has been your experience removing peel & stick after several years?\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — February 13, 2020 @ 2:26 pm Reply\\nHi Rob,\\nThanks for sharing your thoughts! Personally, I’ve used peel-and-stick wallpaper over and over and over and have NEVER had it ruin the walls…including the hex paper shown in this post (we pulled it down after it being up for 2+ years).\\xa0\\nI do always test any paper before I do a full installation (often leaving a swatch up for a few weeks to make sure there isn’t any long-term damage). The most I’ve had peel-and-stick paper do is pull little specs of paint off, which are easily touched up.\\xa0\\nI have so much faith in it that I now use it more than paint in all of our rentals…which we usually move out of every 2-3 years.\\nHope that encourages you to give it a try!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecky — March 7, 2020 @ 7:50 am Reply\\nDid you apply any kind of water proof coating? I’ve heard of that or covering it with glass or plexiglass. Do you think that would be necessary?\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — March 7, 2020 @ 8:11 am Reply\\nHi Becky!\\nNo, I don’t think that’s necessary at all. At least not for the paper we used. Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean. I would just be sure not to pick a fabric-like wallpaper or one with texture, although even some of those would likely be fine. Wallpaper is much more durable than people think!\\nHope that helps!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVanessa — April 8, 2020 @ 11:41 am Reply\\nI love this! Such a great idea. Love your blog! So helpful and great ideas.\\nI can *almost* do this except for having textured walls and living in FL – humidity may make wallpaper not stick to it.\\nWe have a galley kitchen so already no counter space but need something waterproof over the sink. Wall-mounted dish rack is the only way to deal w no counter space. But you would still see the wallpaper behind it.\\nDo you happen to know of a very affordable product or treatment I can use over wallpaper that is waterproof & washable?\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — April 10, 2020 @ 9:29 am Reply\\nHi Vanessa,\\nFirst – make sure you check on my wallpaper on textured walls post here:\\nSecond, in my experience, I have never had wallpaper fall down, bubble or peel up. And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.Please review our full terms contained on ourTerms of Servicepage. | Dew Pt. | 28Â°Fdry | Rel.

With some careful planning and preparation, you can create a stylish backsplash that is long-lasting and easy to maintain. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to properly install wallpaper as a backsplash in your home.\\nChoose the Right Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nWhen selecting a wallpaper for a backsplash application, you’ll want to consider:\\n\\nMoisture resistance – Since the backsplash will be installed behind a sink or stove where it will be exposed to moisture, choose a vinyl or paper wallpaper specifically designed for high-humidity areas. Avoid regular paper wallpapers.\\nWashability – Pick a scrubbable and stain-resistant wallpaper, so it will be easy to keep clean.\\nSize of pattern – Smaller scale patterns will be easiest to work with. Large patterns can be tricky to line up.\\nSheen – Consider how the sheen (matte, satin, semi-gloss, etc.) will interact with your lighting. Glossier papers will be easier to wipe clean.\\nAdhesive – For backsplashes, always use a permanent, heavy-duty adhesive to prevent peeling or bubbling.\\nQuantity – Measure to determine how much wallpaper you will need to cover your backsplash area. Don’t forget to account for pattern matching and cutting allowance.\\n\\nPrepare the Surface\\nProper surface prep is crucial for successful wallpaper installation.\\n\\nMake sure the surface is clean, dry, smooth, and free of grease. Fill any cracks or holes with spackle.\\nSand glossy surfaces lightly to “rough up” and improve adhesion.\\nPrime walls before installing the wallpaper, especially if painting previously. Use an interior wallpaper primer or sealer.\\nFor tile backsplashes, scuff the surface with sandpaper so the adhesive adheres well. Clean thoroughly after sanding.\\n\\nPlan the Layout\\n\\nDecide on your starting point based on the pattern size and shape. It often works best to start in a less visible corner.\\nDetermine if you will need to cut any edges to fit your backsplash area cleanly. Plan ahead for straight cuts.\\nMake sure to match patterns from strip to strip. Plan the layout so seams fall between tiles or at grout lines.\\n\\nPrepare the Wallpaper\\n\\nUnroll the wallpaper and allow it to relax according to manufacturer directions, usually 10-20 minutes.\\nUsing a sharp razor blade, straightedge or wallpaper trimmer, neatly trim off the factory edges. Cut wallpaper strips to your desired length.\\nDraw plumb lines on the surface as guides for your first strip. Use a level and pencil.\\n\\nApply Adhesive\\n\\nApply an even coat of heavy-duty wallpaper adhesive directly onto the backsplash surface using a paint roller or wide brush. Don’t get adhesive on the face of the wallpaper.\\nFold book ends of the strips to keep edges clean and prevent sticking during application.\\nAllow adhesive to become tacky according to manufacturer’s directions before applying wallpaper. This is known as “open time”.\\n\\nInstall the Wallpaper\\n\\nHang your first strip, sliding it into position using a wallpaper smoother or plastic scraper. Move from the middle outwards to squeeze out air pockets. Use a level to keep the strip straight.\\nUse a razor blade to trim excess paper at ceilings, countertops or edges. Make straight cuts.\\nApply the next strip directly beside the first, being careful to match the pattern precisely at the seam. Overlap edges slightly.\\nUse a seam roller to set the seam firmly.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion. I love your ideas.\\n\\n\\nStacey — June 7, 2018 @ 1:01 pm Reply\\nLove this!\\n\\n\\nNancy Glad — August 11, 2018 @ 8:16 am Reply\\nMegan, your info is great – many thanks. Any experience or suggestions for using wallpaper for a backsplash? I want to use nautical maps which are just heavy paper. I would probably need to paint with a clear waterproofing product after it is up.

Personally, I’ve used peel-and-stick wallpaper over and over and over and have NEVER had it ruin the walls…including the hex paper shown in this post (we pulled it down after it being up for 2+ years).\\xa0\\nI do always test any paper before I do a full installation (often leaving a swatch up for a few weeks to make sure there isn’t any long-term damage). The most I’ve had peel-and-stick paper do is pull little specs of paint off, which are easily touched up.\\xa0\\nI have so much faith in it that I now use it more than paint in all of our rentals…which we usually move out of every 2-3 years.\\nHope that encourages you to give it a try!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecky — March 7, 2020 @ 7:50 am Reply\\nDid you apply any kind of water proof coating?

Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean. I would just be sure not to pick a fabric-like wallpaper or one with texture, although even some of those would likely be fine. Wallpaper is much more durable than people think!\\nHope that helps!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVanessa — April 8, 2020 @ 11:41 am Reply\\nI love this! Such a great idea. Love your blog! So helpful and great ideas.\\nI can *almost* do this except for having textured walls and living in FL – humidity may make wallpaper not stick to it.\\nWe have a galley kitchen so already no counter space but need something waterproof over the sink.

And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

But by far, one of the most transformative wallpaper projects I’ve tackled was the backsplash in our ugly California kitchen. Wallpaper is an awesome backsplash alternative to traditional tile (especially for us renters!), but it’s also a fairly tricky installation process thanks to outlets, low-hanging cabinets, appliances, and precise patterns. Today, I’m breaking down exactly how to wallpaper a kitchen backsplash so you feel inspired (and prepared!) to tackle this challenging (but rewarding!) DIY project yourself!\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nToggle\\n\\nBefore & After\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nSupplies Needed\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nBefore & After\\nHere is our kitchen before I added a fun backsplash using peel-and-stick wallpaper. As you can see, I started with a ~ugly~ monochromatic and dark blank slate.\\n\\nAnd here is how the kitchen looked after the application of a bright white hexagon peel-and-stick wallpaper!\\n\\nThe bright white paper infused some lightness and brightness into the otherwise dreary kitchen. The hexagon design nods to a tile pattern, and the gold lines play off the cabinets just enough to make it all work nicely together.\\n\\nAlthough adding a crisp white wallpaper to this dreary space was quite the gamble, it ended up being money and time so well spent (as wallpaper almost always is!)\\n\\n\\nWhile this transformation was well worth the blood, sweat, and tears, it is definitely one of the tricker wallpapering projects I’ve done…so let me walk you through everything you need to know before you tackle something like this in your own space!\\nUsing Wallpaper for a Backsplash\\nIn a “normal” kitchen, a backsplash is usually created with tile. But there might be lots of reasons you don’t want a tiled backsplash including your budget, your DIY confidence, and (as is our case) the permanence. As renters, we can’t do anything permanent to our homes, so wallpaper is an excellent alternative for adding color, pattern, and style to an otherwise bland kitchen.\\nWhy Not Use Peel-and-Stick Tile?\\nI get asked all the time why I don’t use peel-and-stick tile in our rental kitchens. And my answer is: because it’s not removable!\\nJust because something is peel-and-stick doesn’t mean it comes off easily and mess-free. In my experience, peel-and-stick tile is not a removable product and will destroy the drywall as you peel it off. If you want to add a backsplash that is removable, wallpaper (or vinyl decals like I show here) is going to be your best bet.\\nIf you REALLY want to use peel and stick tile, I came up with a clever hack to keep it renter-friendly and totally removable! See it here:\\xa0How to Install a Peel & Stick Tile Backsplash In a Rental (Without Damage!)\\n\\nWhat Type of Wallpaper Is Best for a Backsplash?\\nYou can technically wallpaper a backsplash with any wallpaper (e.g., peel-and-stick, pre-pasted, non-pasted etc). However, since this wallpaper will be in an area that gets wet, moist, and dirty, I do recommend picking a vinyl wallpaper (rather than fabric or textured) that is wipeable (most will indicate so on the packaging).\\nI personally recommending using peel-and-stick wallpaper or heavy-duty contact paper for backsplashes because they are both durable (easy to wipe clean) and removable (it just peels right off!)\\nDoes the Wallpaper Need to Be “Waterproof”?\\nIn my experience, no…at least not for a kitchen. While you may experience some splashing of water or food particles on your wallpapered backsplash, the area will rarely (if ever) get heavily saturated. As such, you will want a wallpaper you can easily wipe clean, but it does not need to be labeled “waterproof” to work well on a backsplash.\\nPicking a Wallpaper Pattern for a Backsplash\\nYou can really pick any wallpaper pattern to put on your backsplash. But if you’re hoping to mimic the look of real tile, keep an eye out for patterns that look like tile! Here are some great examples:\\n\\n1 – Black & White Herringbone | 2 – Grey & Gold Hexagon Paper | 3 – Cream & Neutral Hexagon Paper | 4 – Black Hexagon Wallpaper | 5 – White & Silver Cube Wallpaper | 6 – Blue Medallion Wallpaper | 7 – Black & White Circle Wallpaper | 8 – Grey & White Hexagon Wallpaper | 9 – Faux Brick Wallpaper | 10 – White Subway Tile Wallpaper | 11 – Black Marble Tile Wallpaper | 12 – Long Hexagon Tile Wallpaper | 13 – Marble Herringbone Wallpaper | 14 – Blue Mosaic Tile Wallpaper | 15 – Black & Gold Trellis Wallpaper | 16 – Grey & White Medallion Wallpaper\\nFrom the moment I first saw this photo on the Walls Need Love’s Instagram account, I knew the white and gold hex pattern was perfect for a wallpapered “tile” backsplash for our kitchen!\\nDetermining How Much Wallpaper You Need\\nBefore purchasing your wallpaper, it’s a good idea to accurately measure the space you are wallpapering and devise a plan for how you will use the paper.\\nWhen determining how much paper you need, be sure to take into account:\\n\\nThe surface area you want to cover\\nThe roll dimensions\\nPattern size and scale\\nPattern repeat information (usually detailed on the wallpaper’s web description or packaging)\\nWhich orientation you will hang the paper (as that can affect how much or little you need to cover certain size areas)\\n\\nIf the paper you want to use can be easily returned, considering buying extra, because not being able to finish when you run out of paper can be very…very…frustrating.\\n\\nSupplies Needed\\nEvery project will vary slightly; but in general, here are the supplies you will need to wallpaper a backsplash:\\n\\nWallpaper\\nCutting Tools\\nRotary cutter, ruler and self-healing cutting mat (although a ruler and scissors will do, these tools make it easy to get really precise cuts)\\nSharp scissors\\nSharp craft knife\\n\\n\\nPaddle Scraper – Some wallpapers come with a smoothing tool, but I prefer the wide size and shape of this one for big wallpaper projects.\\nBasic Tools\\nMeasuring tape\\nScrewdrivers for removing outlet covers\\nCalculator\\nNotebook and pencil\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 1: Clear & Clean the Backsplash\\nStart by removing any outlet covers, artwork, or other items covering your backsplash. Wipe down the blank walls of any dust, dirt, debris, grease, oil, or food particles. Let the wall(s) fully dry before applying wallpaper.\\n\\nStep 2: Measure Your Backsplash\\nWallpaper can be expensive, so I highly recommend spending a considerable amount of time planning out exactly how you will apply the paper to your backsplash (and other areas) before you even start cutting and peeling.\\nI mentioned before that wallpapering the backsplash was my trickiest papering job ever, and the picture above shows exactly why. Backsplashes tend to have lots of things that need to be papered around. Outlets are certainly one, but your backsplash might have vents, hoods, shelves, or other items that can’t be removed and need to be considered.\\nTIP! Whenever possible, remove items off the walls/cabinets instead of trying to work around them. Wallpaper is tricky enough to lay flat without anything in the way. I did everything I could to remove the under-cabinet lighting (above) but was unable to do so, which left me having to make tricky cuts around the fixtures.\\nIn order to deal with anything you need to paper around, make a detailed plan of your entire backsplash. As you can see below, I not only detailed out the length and height of each area (to the left of the stove, to the right of the stove, to the right of the window), but I also marked the exact placement of each light and outlet.\\nOn another page (not shown), I dove into even further detail, notating where precisely each light feature was so I could translate those measurements to the wallpaper during the cutting phase (more on that below).\\n\\nStep 3: Plan Your Wallpaper Layout\\nWith the dimensions fully calculated, you can then determine how best to cut your wallpaper.\\nTypically, wallpaper is hung from top to bottom and you work laterally across a space. These days, most paper is printed to be hung vertically, which will make cutting and hanging\\xa0much\\xa0easier.\\nI don’t ever do anything the easy way though. I wanted to use as little wallpaper as possible (because it’s expensive), so I chose to apply the paper horizontally (from left-to-right, rather than top-to-bottom). While this choice certainly added to the complexity of the installation, it did allow me to maximize every inch of paper with very little waste.\\nIn the notebook above (right-hand page), you’ll see I cut each wallpaper strip in half (possible because of the height of my backsplash and the horizontal installation). Instead of a 10′ length of 20″ wide paper (with lots of potential excess thanks to pattern matching), I instead had 20′ of 13″ tall strips that fit the horizontal area above the counter.\\nThis approach may not work for you based on your pattern and orientation preferences, but my point is this: think very carefully about how you can apply the pattern and how you can cut the paper to get the most space covered with as little paper as possible!\\nStep 4: Cut the Wallpaper\\nFiguring out the plan for the wallpaper may very well be your most tedious and time-consuming step. However, once you have all the measurements figured out, you just need to translate them to the wallpaper and get cutting.\\nCut Large Sections First\\nStart by cutting the large rolls down the general sizes determined in your planning. I found it easiest to do large cuts (both length-wise and width-wise) using a rotary cutter and large ruler. Before cutting a particular section, always be sure the patterns line up with the adjoining panels.\\n\\nTIP! I was trying to use up every inch of wallpaper, so I cut my panels down into the exact same measurements as my backsplash. However, if you are able to, try leaving an excess 1-3″ of paper along the top and bottom of each panel so it will perfectly reach the edges of your counters and cabinets no matter how straight (or not) you hang the paper. Then trim away the edges after the paper is on the wall.\\nPre-Cut Details\\nNOTE: If your backsplash area doesn’t have any large or unique features to work around, you can likely skip this step and set right to hanging your larger cuts of paper directly to the wall.\\nWhen papering large expanses of wall, I usually deal with outlets and other features as I’m laying the paper down. However, the backsplash area is such a tight space with so many extra features to work around, that it can be very difficult to get the paper to lie flat without pre-cutting out bulky features.\\nAfter some trial-and-error, I determined it was much easier to cut each feature (the light fixtures) out of the wallpaper before applying it to the wall. To do this, translate the size and placement of any “extra” features (precise size and location measurements are KEY!) to the larger wallpaper strips. In the photo below, you can see the faint lines of the light fixture (along the top) and the outlet (vertical line in the top/middle).\\n\\nOnce you have each feature measured and “drawn,” cut them out using a ruler and very sharp craft knife. This part can feel tedious and a bit scary (slicing big holes in the middle of your wallpaper can be a big risk!) so don’t hesitate to re-measure and double-check as much as necessary!\\n\\nStep 5: Apply the Wallpaper\\nOnce you have all the necessary features cut out of the wallpaper strip, it’s time to apply it! As I mentioned above, I chose to hang my temporary wallpaper horizontally to conserve paper and eliminate excessive match lines on such a small area.\\nNo matter how you are applying your paper (top-to-bottom or side-to-side), peel off just a few inches of the paper backing from the top/side of the wallpaper. Stick that leading edge to the wall, ensuring it is as straight as possible. Then as you work across/down the wall, slowly peel away the paper backing and smooth the paper down with a large paddle scraper.\\n\\nAs you get to edges, outlets, and corners, use a sharp craft knife to make notches as necessary (to relieve paper tension) or trim away extra paper. Once you get the paper in place, use the scraper to really adhere the paper to the wall and work out any wrinkles or bubbles.\\n\\nContinuing hanging your panels, matching up the patterns and working around features, until your entire backsplash area is covered in removable wallpaper!\\nWorking Around Outlets\\nBefore hanging the wallpaper on the wall, I recommend creating a single vertical slit for each outlet (to relieve the paper tension and allow the paper to lay flat on the surrounding wall). Once the paper is fully adhered to the wall, re-visit the outlets to trim away extra paper and ensure it’s laying smooth and flat in every direction. Replace outlet covers only once you’re satisfied with the placement and smoothness of the wallpaper.\\n\\nMore Application Tips & Tricks\\nMy pictures and descriptions make it sound like you just lay the paper down, replace your outlet covers, and walk away. In truth, it will require a lot of placing, peeling off and re-placing; tugging and pulling; sweating; and maybe even crying. Working with peel-and-stick paper CAN be very exasperating, so here are some things to keep in mind:\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to pull it off and re-lay it down. Whether it’s your initial 2″ or the full sheet, if it’s angled funny or has lots of wrinkles you can’t easily get out with a scraper, simply peel the sheet off and re-stick it. I promise, it will stick again.\\nDon’t force it. If your initial 2″ of paper aren’t quite level, the paper will only continue to “veer off course” as you move down/across the wall. It’s better to peel it off and re-align the panel instead of trying to re-route the paper further down the wall.\\nCorners. I chose to cut long strips of paper that would stretch into and past the corners so that the pattern would continue nicely. However, getting paper to “turn the corner” straight can be very difficult. In hindsight, I would have sliced the paper at each corner and started a fresh application at each turn.\\nThe paper is REALLY durable. Don’t hesitate to bend, wrinkle, or curl up the paper as you’re working with it. It’s veeeery durable and once you have it smoothed onto your wall, those bends and wrinkles won’t even be noticeable.\\nTake a step back. Despite my efforts for the smoothest application possible, I was still left with some pretty considerable wrinkles in the paper (those darn corners!). But that’s actually one of the best things about wallpaper. It’s so “big picture,” and those small imperfections aren’t really noticeable in day-to-day life. So do the best you can, step away, and just enjoy the improved view!\\n\\nDeciding Where to Stop the Wallpapered Backsplash\\nOne of the trickiest things about backsplashes (tiled, painted, papered, anything!) is deciding where to stop. In some kitchens, there will be doors, trim, appliances, molding, or ends of counter top that make it very clear where the wallpaper installation should end. Other times, it’s not as evident.\\nMy original plan was to only tile the backsplash, and I used the width of our countertop and the height of the cabinets as my guide (as seen below).\\n\\nBut even as I stepped back, put my supplies away, and called the job done, the “tiling” really bothered me. The white paper felt random in the context of the rest of the kitchen; and instead of my eye drifting to the pretty paper, it kept drifting to the ceiling where there was none. Below is a quick snapshot I took as I debated (for weeks!) what to do about it.\\n\\nI finally decided that I needed to extend the wallpaper up the wall to the ceiling in order to make it work. After a quick calculation, I determined I had enough paper leftover to cover the remaining wall (I originally bought enough to “tile” the fireplace in the adjoining family room too).\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about installing wallpaper above cabinets is that there is usually nothing to work around…no outlets, no lights! As such, I just cut the paper into strips and put it right up, matching the pattern as I went around the kitchen.\\n\\nWe lived with just the backsplash area done for about 2 months before I finally did the rest of the wall, and to say the change was dramatic is an understatement. The wallpapered backsplash went from feeling random and disjointed to providing a fun and fresh detail that really woke up the entire kitchen.\\nIf your cabinets do not reach the ceiling or a soffit, I highly recommend wallpapering the area above the cabinets for the most visual impact.\\n\\n\\nIn the three years we lived in this house, I was never\\xa0really able to get used to the brown cabinets and brown counters and brown floors. But the small temporary changes I was able to make (like the wallpapered backsplash and this simple window valance) truly helped me like the space a lot more than the dull cave we started with. Although this wallpaper backsplash wasn’t the easiest DIY I’ve taken on, it was certainly one of the most rewarding!\\n\\nOther Renter-Friendly Kitchen Updates\\n\\nHow to Shiplap a Kitchen Island with Command Strips\\nA DIY Butcher Block Island Countertop (Anyone Can Do!)\\nAn Easy Way to Add Pattern to Your Pantry with Wrapping Paper\\n\\nWhether you rent or own, I suspect most of us have aspects of our homes we just don’t love.

It makes such a difference. Here’s another suggestion for you. Chalkboard vinyl on the panels of your cabinet doors. My son-in-law suggested that I paint my doors with the chalkboard paint, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so permanent. I found the vinyl online though, on some sort of deal, and I LOVE IT. It is fun to label my cabinets, and it would cut way back on the brown in your kitchen. (I think it would coordinate with the black on your fridge and appliances, too.) Anyway, just a suggestion. I love your ideas.\\n\\n\\nStacey — June 7, 2018 @ 1:01 pm Reply\\nLove this!\\n\\n\\nNancy Glad — August 11, 2018 @ 8:16 am Reply\\nMegan, your info is great – many thanks. Any experience or suggestions for using wallpaper for a backsplash? I want to use nautical maps which are just heavy paper. I would probably need to paint with a clear waterproofing product after it is up. I wallpapered a powder room with National Geographic maps and it turned out fantastic but they don’t get splashed with water and the occasional tomato sauce splatter. – Keep up the great work! (Lining drawers with wallpaper is another brillliant idea – thanks)\\n\\n\\nRob — February 13, 2020 @ 7:08 am Reply\\nLove the paper design you chose.\\nI’ve always wanted to use peel & stick wallpaper but have heard horror stories of removal. Don’t be surprised if when removing (because your renting) some of the sheetrock paper comes off as well; meaning now you have to texture in a rental.\\nWondering – was has been your experience removing peel & stick after several years?\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — February 13, 2020 @ 2:26 pm Reply\\nHi Rob,\\nThanks for sharing your thoughts! Personally, I’ve used peel-and-stick wallpaper over and over and over and have NEVER had it ruin the walls…including the hex paper shown in this post (we pulled it down after it being up for 2+ years).\\xa0\\nI do always test any paper before I do a full installation (often leaving a swatch up for a few weeks to make sure there isn’t any long-term damage). The most I’ve had peel-and-stick paper do is pull little specs of paint off, which are easily touched up.\\xa0\\nI have so much faith in it that I now use it more than paint in all of our rentals…which we usually move out of every 2-3 years.\\nHope that encourages you to give it a try!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBecky — March 7, 2020 @ 7:50 am Reply\\nDid you apply any kind of water proof coating? I’ve heard of that or covering it with glass or plexiglass. Do you think that would be necessary?\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — March 7, 2020 @ 8:11 am Reply\\nHi Becky!\\nNo, I don’t think that’s necessary at all. At least not for the paper we used. Most peel-and-stick papers are like a thick contact paper, so they can easily be wiped clean. I would just be sure not to pick a fabric-like wallpaper or one with texture, although even some of those would likely be fine. Wallpaper is much more durable than people think!\\nHope that helps!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVanessa — April 8, 2020 @ 11:41 am Reply\\nI love this! Such a great idea. Love your blog! So helpful and great ideas.\\nI can *almost* do this except for having textured walls and living in FL – humidity may make wallpaper not stick to it.\\nWe have a galley kitchen so already no counter space but need something waterproof over the sink. Wall-mounted dish rack is the only way to deal w no counter space. But you would still see the wallpaper behind it.\\nDo you happen to know of a very affordable product or treatment I can use over wallpaper that is waterproof & washable?\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — April 10, 2020 @ 9:29 am Reply\\nHi Vanessa,\\nFirst – make sure you check on my wallpaper on textured walls post here:\\nSecond, in my experience, I have never had wallpaper fall down, bubble or peel up. And we have lived in North Carolina, Kansas, California and Virginia. That said, I would ALWAYS do a test on any wall and leave it up for a while before you do a full installation.\\nThird, most peel-and-stick wallpapers are wipeable/washable. So if the wallpaper DOES stay up, you’d be able to clean it without any issue. The white wallpaper in this post was wiped down with a wet rag constantly.\\nFinally, if you determine you do need something over the wallpaper, some sort of plexiglass/acrylic sheet could work (although it would be pricey) or you could try clear contact paper.\\xa0\\nHope those thoughts help a bit!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDS53 — October 12, 2020 @ 9:46 pm Reply\\nYou are so very inspiring!\\n\\n\\nthehomesihavemade — October 16, 2020 @ 8:51 am Reply\\nThanks so much…glad you stopped by!\\nMegan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShonda — April 14, 2022 @ 10:58 am Reply\\nAny thoughts on how you would manage an outside corner with wallpaper?\\n\\n\\nMegan — April 14, 2022 @ 12:03 pm Reply\\nHi Shonda!\\nI’m not sure what you mean by outside corner…do you mean one that protrudes outward rather than in?\\nI actually think paper bends easier around a protruding\\xa0corner, but it will still be tricky to keep it perfectly level. I’d give it a try going around the corner first. If you can’t get the follow-on paper to line up level, then you could technically cut it at the corner and start over, but you run the risk of the seam being really visible.\\xa0\\nIf you cut your paper 1-2″ taller than you need, you’d be able to turn the corner and not have any gap between the paper and the upper cabinets, even if it does go a little off as you make the bend.\\nDoes that help?\\nThanks!Megan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent Sidebar\\n\\nHi, I'm Megan!\\nI am a military spouse, mom to 3 young boys, and a constant creator.

For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested last fall, keep wearing it! Dark chocolate brown styles pair particularly nicely with spring’s softer color palette of wispy pinks and pale yellows.\\nAs for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid, and its first cousin, gingham. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite last fall, and it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If your wardrobe already has a spirited amount of checks, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—another major theme this spring that was put forward at Dries Van Noten, Gucci, and Miu Miu, where high-impact, retro-inspired prints were piled on in an artfully chaotic manner. (If it looks wrong, it’s probably right.)\\nThese and more key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends to know and shop now as spring deliveries land in stores.\\nRunway: Loewe Spring 2025; Valentino Spring 2025; Marina Moscone Spring 2025; Alexander McQueen Spring 2025; Erdem Spring 2025\\nFemininity Unraveled\\nSoft pastels brought romance and airiness to the runways, but the color palette didn’t feel overly feminine.

Sabato de Sarno showed various fitted zip-up jackets at Gucci, while Bottega and Miu Miu reimagined the wind breaker—Matthieu Blazy notably lined his in plaid, a carryover from fall we’ll get into next. But other kinds of lightweight outerwear were also introduced. At Prada, Miuccia and Raf Simons showed a suede style, proof that fashion’s ongoing obsession with the texture isn’t going anywhere. A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring. Investing in next-season outerwear now doesn’t mean you have to wait until March to wear your pieces—layer similar styles from Gucci and Loewe under heavier coats to maximize their cost per wear.\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nTechnical silk zipper jacket\\n$4,000MIU MIU\\n\\n& Other Stories\\npatch-pocket leather jacket\\n$549& OTHER STORIES\\n\\nCo\\nrolled collar jacket\\n$795SAKS FIFTH AVENUE\\n\\nPrada\\ndrawstring zip-up jacket\\n$2,350BERGDORF GOODMAN\\n\\nBarbour\\nx Alexa Chung Anna cotton-blend jacket\\n$425NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nLoewe\\nTrapeze jacket\\n$6,700LOEWE\\nRunway: Acne Studios Spring 2025; Kallmeyer Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025; The Row Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025\\nPhotos: Courtesy of GoRunway.com\\nChecks and Balances\\nPlaid may be synonymous with fall—where it indeed saw a resurgence this season—but its presence in the spring collections takes on a softer tune. Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look.\\n\\nThe Row\\nTavishina coat\\n$3,250THE ROW\\n\\nDôen\\nJoelle ruffled checked organic cotton top\\n$200NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nSimkhai\\nCalliope vest\\n$495FWRD\\n\\nZara\\ngingham midiskirt\\n$60ZARA\\n\\nBottega Veneta\\nwrap-effect checked cotton-blend tweed midi skirt\\n$2,300NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nPosse\\nMackenzie trousers\\n$250POSSE\\nRunway: Versace Spring 2025; Dries Van Noten Spring 2025; Valentino Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025\\nLet’s Go Thrifting\\nMaximalists will always have print, and this season encourages us to revisit the art of the clash with retro-inspired patterns. A devil-may-care approach will be rewarded here, but if your less-is-more tendencies are too strong to rebel against, a graphic top or skirt (ideally one that looks, or is, vintage) will do the trick.

A happy medium can be found at Saint Laurent, where the many full suiting looks in the collection were inspired by the house founder, and meant to convey “control and power,” as designer Anthony Vaccarello told Vogue’s Mark Holgate post-show backstage.

The season as a whole felt uplifting, positive and women-friendly; the overall message being, as Nicole Phelps put it: “You don’t have to renounce your strength to be feminine.” Or, as Muhammad Ali so memorably said: “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.”\\nFashion can take us places, and one of designers’ chosen destinations for spring was cloud nine. This was a season in which air was the predominant element and ethereality abounded. Chiffons floated and jerseys swung in unison with the body – movement being another key theme. Cloud-like dresses were buoyed with stuffing at Comme des Garçons and Torishéju, or actually inflated at Anrealage; elsewhere, more traditional balloon skirts puffed out the picture. At the same time, autumn’s fascination with 2D flatness evolved to the point where many garments seemed to defy gravity, an aesthetic set in motion seasons ago by Glenn Martens’s use of wire at Y/Project, and Demna’s “windswept” couture look.\\nRead more: BAFTAs 2025 Red Carpet\\nDesigners this season encouraged a willing suspension of disbelief, meaning an openness to a sense of wonder – and not just when it came to the clothes. At Bottega Veneta, chairs were magicked into squishy creatures, and backstage Matthieu Blazy showcased a copy of Richard Scarry’s Biggest Word Book Ever with a custom intrecciato cover. Scarry’s Busy, Busy World and What Do People Do All Day? would’ve been equally apropos for a season in which many shows celebrated individuality, rather than showcasing a narrative through-line. That’s also how the world works in Busy Town, where the reader is introduced to all manner of folk – their jobs, attire, and accoutrements (pickle car, anyone?) – going about their business with more or less finesse. And don’t tell me there is no connection between Lowly Worm and Blazy’s one-legged pants! Skousers and skorts were news this season.\\nThe presence of plaids, typically an autumn/winter theme, speaks to the a-seasonality of our global world. It also evokes grunge and its attendant “come as you are” ethos. “Fashion needs to get messed up,” said Balenciaga’s Demna, and he wasn’t the only designer who rejected perfectionism in favour of something more lived-in.\\n\\nSpring/summer 2025 trends overview:\\nAccordionItemContainerButton\\n\\nU-turns: tank tops\\nBewitched: the seduction of dark romance\\nLeg it: skorts and skirts-over-pants\\nSoft filter: tulle wraps\\nGet sporty: upping the game on athleisure staples\\nTeen spirit: plaid for spring\\nScout’s honour: utility gear in khaki and olive\\nContinuous loop: spiral silhouettes\\nFine and dandy: masculine archetypes\\nTomato, tomato: fruity red for spring\\nBells and whistles: adornments aplenty\\nMake it rain: the ascent of the waterproof\\nInto the fold: the pleated skirt\\n\\n\\nAt Alaïa, Peter Mulier introduced the idea of the spiral, while the Möbius strip made an appearance at Courrèges, where Nicolas Di Felice addressed the feeling of nostalgia-soaked postmodernism running as if in a continuous loop. “In the period that we live in, it’s always a comeback to something else – and I’m not talking only about fashion – so I decided we’re going to work on cycles and repetition,” the designer said. Indeed this season’s trends are largely a remix of tendencies designers have been playing with for the past two years or so, such as Madame Grès-inspired draping, balletcore, etc. These ideas are reframed to be sure, but it is hard to shake the feeling that the world is at a tipping point.\\n The Best Street Style From Milan Fashion Week 100 Photos By Phil Oh View Gallery\\nMost Popular\\n\\n\\n\\nBeauty\\n4 Signs You’re Not Getting Enough Protein\\nBy Lorena Meouchi\\n\\n\\n\\nFashion\\nSorry Sambas, These Eco-Conscious Trainers Are This Spring’s Sleeper Hit\\nBy Daisy Jones\\n\\n\\n\\nVogue Retail\\nVogue Retail: Accessories & Swimwear\\n\\n\\nStill, stasis is not an option; the world, and fashion, must proceed. There is work to be done. In a strangely apolitical season, Willy Chavarría’s América show told the story of the USA “through the voice of the immigrants, and the people who make this motherfucker run”, as the designer put it. And it stood out. If you think about it, utilitarian workers’ gear forms the basis of American style: jeans, t-shirts and tank tops, khakis. Fashion isn’t finished with barn-jacket beige and for spring the hue appeared in scouting and military-inspired looks. Olive drab, a hue known to army brats (not to be confused with Charli’s brats), expanded the palette.\\nSeemingly no collection was without some kind of slim and sleek tank silhouette; fashion’s Olympics-fuelled athletic fixation has not yet waned. At Christian Dior, tanks had a sporty aspect. We also saw sophisticated takes on sportiness like billowy polo dresses and windbreakers in materials from nylon to satin, to wear with sequinned dresses.\\nCircles and discs, symbols associated with femininity, were also abundant. The invitation to Jonathan Anderson’s spring show for Loewe was a ring, and on the runway the man who resurrected the structured pannier for spring/summer 2023, went further back in history to bring the bell-shaped hoop skirt back into rotation. His had a weightlessness the originals lacked. Panniers put in an appearance too, most notably on side-bolstered robe de style dresses popularised a century ago by Jeanne Lanvin. Also coming out from the shadows were bewitching looks. These ranged from the darkly mysterious (banshees were referenced at McQueen; Disney’s Wicked antiheroines made their presence known), to the romantic á la Stevie Nicks’s “Rhiannon” (who, as “a woman taken by the wind” is exceedingly on trend). Seduction is a kind of sorcery that designers played with via cone bras and transparent (tulle) veiling that was like a physical replication of a soft filter.\\nSoftness and fluidity are not far apart, and into this especially feminine season, dandies made a dramatic entrance. At Saint Laurent the house founder was the muse. Sailors, Renaissance princes, Tudor kings, Little Lord Fauntleroy, and other storybook characters also came to life on the runways.\\nThis analysis of the most directional spring trends is based on a review of over 400 brands in the four fashion capitals (New York, London, Milan, and Paris) as well as Tokyo, Copenhagen, and Berlin, plus women’s looks presented during menswear. Read on for the key takeaways from the spring/summer 2025 runways to consider incorporating into your wardrobe.\\n\\nU-turns: tank tops\\nThe humble tank top has been a permanent fixture on the seasonal runways for some time – and they took centre stage once again for spring/summer. Rather than forming a quiet foundation for outfits, as they have done for many decades, the basic was a clincher of looks at Rabanne (worn as a dress, with silver chainmail detailing atop), Willy Chavarria (worn with belted wide-leg trousers), 16Arlington (knitted and sheer), Ralph Lauren (worn with a high-waisted, embellished gold skirt) and Stella McCartney, where tanks came emblazoned with “mother” across the chest and “fucker” in small print below. The classic scooped neckline was a resounding winner – take note.\\n\\n\\nWales Bonner\\nSonic Striped Jersey Tank\\n£195net-a-porter\\n\\nDickies\\nRibbed Vest Top\\n£25dickies\\n\\nWeekday\\nStud Detailed Tank Top\\n£20weekday\\n\\nStella McCartney\\nChunky Chain Tank Top\\n£890stella mccartney\\n\\n& Other Stories\\nMetal-Buckle Tank Top\\n£27& OTHER STORIES\\n\\nCOPERNI\\nEmoji Cotton Tank Top\\n£336MyTheresa\\nBewitched: the seduction of dark romance\\nThere’s been a gothic mood lingering in fashion for some time, spurred by releases including Wednesday, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and Nosferatu. Free-spirited or severe, looks that embodied dark romance were interspersed throughout the collections. At Rick Owens – the king of drama – there were, naturally, plenty that would double-up as a winning costume, while Alessandro Michele’s Valentino debut brought with it whimsical yet mysterious florals. Elsewhere, Standing Ground’s Michael Stewart poised cameras on the front-row with his hooded velvet gown; ditto Balenciaga’s angular-shouldered closing look, worn by house muse, Eliza Douglas. The easiest way to welcome this attitude-ridden mood into your wardrobe? Consult Saint Laurent’s flowing boho dresses, which were worn beneath heavy-duty leather jackets.\\n\\n\\nCECILIE BAHNSEN\\nBlack Opal Midi-Dress\\n£1,200Ssense\\n\\nNensi Dojaka\\nMuslin Silk Shirt\\n~£530~ £283Farfetch\\n\\nRat & Boa\\nBlack Lace Pirella Dress\\n£275rat and boa\\n\\nAlaïa\\nStrapless Pleated Stretch-Jersey Midi-Dress\\n£2,450net-a-porter\\n\\nJil Sander\\nRuffled Smocked Twill Jacket\\n£2,460NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nRóhe\\nLace-Panelled Matte Satin Maxi Slip Dress\\n~£510~ £306Harvey Nichols\\nLeg it: skorts and skirts-over-pants\\nFashion loves a hybrid, and this season skants, skousers and one-legged pants are vying for our attention. See: Matthieu Blazy’s sophisticated take on the trend that’s taken Gen-Z by storm; elevated in a rigid all-black silhouette. London talent Johanna Parv, meanwhile, provided a practical option rendered in crunchy light grey shell – worn with a cycle-inspired purple zip-down top, a headband and wraparound sunglasses for ultimate high-low athleisure style. While there were many hybrid versions on offer, there was also endless styling inspiration in the form of skirts – mainly midi and mini – worn atop jeans and tailored trousers.

For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, “naked dressing” is commonplace every season – especially in spring/summer collections, when the weather is much more forgiving. There were looks destined for the red carpet, at Tom Ford, Philosophy Di Lorenzo Serafini, Simone Rocha, Sportmax and London’s resident sheer aficionado, Nensi Dojaka. And a way to feasibly incorporate mesh into everyday style, courtesy of Dries Van Noten, where a mint tunic was layered atop a double-breasted lilac blazer.\\n\\n\\nChristopher Esber\\nSonora Veiled Ruched Top\\n£495mytheresa\\n\\nSimone Rocha\\nSheer Tulle Pencil Skirt\\n£445MyTheresa\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\nDouble-Layer Organza Midi Dress\\n£59.95massimo dutti\\n\\nNensi Dojaka\\nBlack & Brown Semi-Sheer Gathered Long Sleeve Bodysuit\\n£595ssense\\n\\nCOS\\nThe Tulle Maxi Dress\\n£225cos\\n\\nPrada\\nOrganza Midi-Skirt\\n£1,240prada\\nGet sporty: upping the game on athleisure staples\\nFootball cups, the Olympics, World Championships… an endless stream of sports tournaments – and a pandemic spent in tracksuits – has fully integrated sportswear into fashion, and there were several new ideas at the shows to take on board for 2025. Take cues from the block-coloured track jackets at Miu Miu, Tolu Coker and GCDS, and the sporty ballet-pink silky separates at Simone Rocha and Ferragamo. The ultimate interpretation of sportif fashion arrived at Wales Bonner, via effortlessly styled mainline pieces and new pieces from her ongoing collaboration with Adidas Originals.

Whichever your preference, the plaid memo for spring was realised as everything from separates to classic, Cobain-esque flannel shirts, coats and ruffled skirts. The Row’s look book brought an elegant rendition of the print: look 38 comprised a square-neck maxi dress secured with black bows at the shoulders, while Matthieu Blazy – who famously sent Kate Moss down his sophomore spring/summer 2023 Bottega Veneta runway in trompe l’oeil leather “jeans”, a white tank top and a checked shirt, worn nonchalantly undone – explored the pattern once again for spring/summer 2025, as a thick coat-come-shirt.\\n\\n\\nFrame\\nBaja Plaid Shirt\\n£235Mytheresa\\n£240FRAME\\n\\nIsabel Marant Étoile\\nTijuana Midi-Skirt\\n£275Ssense\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nPlaid Tailored Trousers\\n£600acne studios\\n\\nAcne Studios\\nChecked Stretch-Jersey Turtleneck Top\\n£230net-a-porter\\n\\nDime\\nBlack & White Triple Plaid Shirt\\n£195ssense\\n\\nZara\\nChecked Midi-Skirt\\n£60Zara\\nScout’s honour: utility gear in khaki and olive\\nPrepped with pockets, buttons, poppers and the like, 2025’s take on utilitarian is as practical as it is stylish. Consider Sacai’s cargo trousers, Isabel Marant’s desert-hued waistcoat, or funnel-neck jackets from Gucci and Mugler your new uniform. With all the functional fashion, some looks were imbued with scout-ish charm, interpreted literally by Fashion East’s Olly Shinder, who flourished one look with a preppy hat and neckerchief.\\n\\n\\nUniqlo\\nUtility Short Jacket\\n£70Uniqlo\\n\\nMiu Miu\\nChino Cotton Miniskirt\\n£800MyTheresa\\n\\nCOS\\nBarrel-Leg Utility Trousers\\n£85Cos\\n\\nR13\\nRibbed Flight Bomber Jacket\\n~£1,315~ £692Ssense\\n\\nWardrobe.NYC\\nBlack Utility Track Trousers\\n£530ssense\\n\\nGucci\\nWomen's Horsebit Ankle Boot\\n£875GUCCI\\nContinuous loop: spiral silhouettes\\nNo designer explored the spiralled silhouette more than Pieter Mulier, who for Alaïa spring/summer 2025 echoed the infrastructure of the Guggenheim – where his show was held – via brushed shearling chubbies and micro-pleated dresses that snapped onto the body, made using similar techniques to jewellery manufacturing. Draped spiral silhouettes debuted at Atlein, Luar, Peter Do and Tibi, while Ludovic de Saint Sernin nodded to Alaïa’s iconic zipper dress with an unravelling eyelet-trimmed dress, with tiered bands that were suspended by invisible threads.\\n\\n\\nPrada\\nNavy Wool Mini Skirt\\n£1,290Browns Fashion\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\nWool Scarf Sweater\\n£119Massimo Dutti\\n\\nChristopher Esber\\nTorsion Coil Ruched Top\\n£455MYTHERESA\\n\\nSea\\nAverie Crochet-Trimmed Shell Bomber Jacket\\n£870NET-A-PORTER\\n\\nCECILIE BAHNSEN\\nBlack Geo Tank Top\\n£540SSENSE\\n\\nChristopher Esber\\nTaupe Castillo Tank Top\\n~£440~ £324SSENSE\\nFine and dandy: masculine archetypes\\nAnthony Vaccarello’s coterie of suited models set the tone for tailoring in 2025. “My last men’s show in March had been all about tailoring, but based on flou; I wanted this one to be the opposite – more strict,” the designer said of his collection. “It’s not about when I would do a tuxedo for a woman which was worn naked underneath. The suits come with shirts, ties. You’re dressed. It’s about control, and power, in a way.” For fine and dandy inspiration, see also: Willy Chavarria, Nicholas Daley and Ann Demeulemeester, to name but a few.\\n\\n\\nVintage\\nEaton Grey Blazer\\n£60Rokit\\n\\nDuke + Dexter\\nPenny Loafers\\n£250Duke + Dexter\\n\\nGucci\\nHeavy Cotton-Poplin Shirt\\n£1,150Gucci\\n\\nCOS\\nStudio Bowling Bag\\n£270Cos\\n\\nFilippa K\\nTailored Cotton Trousers\\n£250filippa k\\n\\nMassimo Dutti\\nSilk And Wool Tie\\n£60Massimo Dutti\\nTomato, tomato: fruity red for spring\\nOne of the key colours to emerge from the spring/summer 2025 shows was hard to look away from. Tomato shades in all their vibrant glory were realised in everything from basic staples to statement pieces and accessories at Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta – the latter of which released a red, leather-clad Biggest Word Book Ever!, made in collaboration with Richard Scarry. Miuccia Prada also took her Miu Miu bow in a tomato-hued ensemble.\\n\\n\\nAlaïa\\nMesh Shoulder Bag\\n£950Net-a-Porter\\n\\nAligne\\nJacob Knitted Hoodie\\n£129ALIGNE\\n\\nJil Sander\\nDouble Layered Midi-Skirt\\n£530Ssense\\n\\nLOEWE\\nPuzzle Bag\\n£1,093Vestiaire Collective\\n\\nMarks & Spencer\\nStudded Buckle Flat Ballet Pumps\\n£40Marks & Spencer\\n\\nGabriela Hearst\\nPontus Crocheted Wool And Silk-Blend Tank\\n£790net-a-porter\\nBells and whistles: adornments aplenty\\nSequins, crystals, feathers, carabiner clips – you name an embellishment, the spring/summer runways had it. As ever, Chopova Lowena’s offering was a smorgasbord of playful jangling adornments; suspended from skirts, emblazoned across denim and climbing models’ plaits (expect the glittering hair bows to be quite the hit among the brand’s fervid fanbase). Whether you buy something pre-embellished or take a turn in DIY upcycling, “more is more” is one of the key memos for spring.\\n\\n\\nPrada\\nRibbed Knit Jersey Top With Embroidery\\n£1,500PRADA\\n\\nSimone Rocha\\nEmbellished Tulle Parka\\n~£1,625~ £650Net-a-Porter\\n\\n16Arlington\\nSuero Sequin-Embellished Top\\n£250farfetch\\n\\nRóhe\\nSilk Organza Tulip Midi-Skirt\\n£580harrods\\n\\nPritch\\nPierced Raven Blazer\\n£1,855pritch\\n\\nRabanne\\nChainmail And Jersey Minidress\\n£2,520net-a-porter\\nMake it rain: the ascent of the waterproof\\nOn the fashion forecast for spring? Waterproofs that can be worn weather permitting – or not.
